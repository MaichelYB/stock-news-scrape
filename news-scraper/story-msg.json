contender holding the top spot for some time as well While the other two big tech players have been at the top for many years Nvidia wasnt even in the top 20 in 2021 This highlights its incredible climb over the course of the last few years Market capitalization the result of multiplying a companys share price by the number of outstanding shares is an imperfect measure of a companys value but its a useful guide Its certainly reflective of a companys dominance in a market and Nvidia has been dominant in artificial intelligence AI Can investors expect this to continue The rollout of Blackwell the newest iteration of Nvidias Superchips is imminent and demand is extremely high The pace of growth of AI training models is staggering and despite Blackwell chips being more than twice as powerful as their predecessors CEO Jensen Huang explained that customers are demanding an even greater number of Blackwells for their data centers He told analysts that current versions of AI models could use a maximum of 100000 of the previous Hopper chips but new models start at 100000 Blackwell chips Thats driving a demand that he referred to as insane Its been reported Nvidia is sold out of Blackwell for at least 12 months even as it attempts to ramp up production partnering with Foxconn to build the worlds largest Blackwell production facility in Mexico Investors will see how this plays out but things look good for the rollout of the companys most important product Its successful launch will drive sales likely leading to another year of growth in the healthy double digits Morgan Stanley analysts believe there could be a 44 gain in topline revenue over the next year Since the AI boom took off the lions share of Nvidias revenue has flowed in from Silicon Valley companies that build and operate the physical data centers that enable AI think Alphabet and Microsoft The latter announced recently that it expects to spend a staggering 80 billion in AI infrastructure in fiscal year 2025 That represents a 60 increase from 2024s roughly 50 billion and is significantly more than the 63 billion some analysts expected Last years spend was already a record amount and significantly more than the year before Look at Microsofts growth in capital expenditures over the last five years the majority of this has come from building AI data centers and buying Nvidia chips This trend isnt leveling off but accelerating and is great news for companies like Nvidia that are downstream of this spending Its also very unlikely that Microsoft will be alone in this If Microsoft expects to grow its AI spending to this degree you can be sure that others around Silicon Valley will follow suit All signs at the moment point to Nvidia continuing to dominate an everexpanding market one that PwC one of the big four accounting firms believes can add 157 trillion to the global economy by 2030 Is Nvidias client base tightening their belts Signs of this are not only absent but also the opposite of whats been happening The massive expansion of AI data center spending by Microsoft is a critically positive sign for Nvidia and its bottom line at least for the next year I believe that Nvidias reign will continue through 2025 Its also very possible that it will take the top spot leapfrogging Apple to once again become the largest company in the world Before you buy stock in

Sign in to access your portfolio","Tip Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results Many analysts on Wall Street expect to see the first 4 trillion company sometime in 2025 Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA has seen its value soar amid rampant artificial intelligence AI spending as big tech companies race to build out bigger data centers and train more advanced AI models With big tech planning to spend even more in 2025 its strong results should continue Its market cap climbed from 416 billion the day OpenAI released ChatGPT to 343 trillion as of this writing The only company Nvidia trails in size is Apple NASDAQ AAPL which has long sat at or near the top of the worlds most valuable companies Apples massive iPhone user base has supported a growing services business over the past decade and AI could propel that services business in 2025 as it integrates more advanced capabilities into its iOS and macOS operating systems Its market cap sits at 367 trillion as of this writing Meanwhile Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT is leading in AI on two fronts An early investment in OpenAI gave it the integrations it needed to sell developers on its Azure cloud computing platform Azure sales have accelerated as a result and management expects that trend to continue in 2025 Meanwhile Microsofts leading position in enterprise productivity software and PC operating systems gives it a huge market for its Copilot AI agents which help improve accuracy and worker productivity It has a market cap of 316 trillion as of this writing Any of the above could become the first 4 trillion company in 2025 But one company could leapfrog them on the path to 5 trillion by the end of the decade The big reason for all of the excitement around AI is its ability to transform multiple industries And one company has its hand in several of those industries Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Thats why it could be the first company to reach a 5 trillion valuation Amazon is one of the biggest investors in AI Management said during its thirdquarter earnings call in September that it expected to spend 75 billion on capital expenditures in 2024 The majority of that spending will go toward its cloud computing business Amazon Web Services AWS and other technology infrastructure Some will go toward the continued buildout of its logistics network Amazons spending is absolutely massive but its proven to be well worth the price Even while investing more than any other big tech company its generating record amounts of free cash flow Free cash flow climbed to 477 billion over the trailing 12 months in Q3 more than doubling year over year Those strong financial results are driven by Amazons diverse operations AWS has been a strong driving force AWS sales accelerated in 2024 increasing 19 year over year in Q3 Moreover AWS now has substantial scale which shows up in operating income growth of 49 in Q3 AWS growth is powered by Amazons support for advanced AI development across multiple foundation models It continues to work on more efficient custombuilt AI accelerators for training and inference which give its customers lowercost options compared to Nvidias chips Meanwhile the core of Amazon has always been its ecommerce business Amazon continues to grow its share of ecommerce year after year despite strong competition from bigbox retailers improving their online operations and ultracheap alternatives like Temu and Shein The main reason Amazon has proved so successful at defending and expanding its lead is its Prime membership Prime subscriptions give customers free oneday shipping on millions of items on Amazons marketplace along with various other benefits including Prime Video The growth of Prime is a virtuous cycle whereby more members attract more merchants offering a wider variety of goods in turn attracting more Prime members Amazons subscription services revenue continues to climb at a doubledigit pace despite its high penetration rate among consumers Amazon isnt just standing by and letting the flywheel spin Its actively pushing It overhauled its logistics operations in 2023 to focus on multiple regions throughout the United States It uses advanced algorithms that predict demand and monitor instock levels to ensure items remain in stock across each region The new regionalized network forms the foundation of a burgeoning logistics services business as well Finally Amazons strong position in ecommerce has helped it build a massive digital advertising business Ad sales totaled 536 billion over the trailing 12 months Amazon should be able to sustain that pace as it expands video advertising all Prime memberships include adsupported streaming by default Generative AI has the potential to supercharge ad sales on Amazon especially considering Amazons scale and data which can fuel iterative testing for ad campaigns ensuring better conversions for merchants Amazons business is operated with one key metric in mind longterm freecashflow generation To that end its been a wild success As mentioned free cash flow totaled 477 billion over the last 12 months Thats up from about 1 billion 10 years ago Over the next five years free cash flow could climb even higher AWS fueled by the growth of AI is showing strong improvements in operating income Despite the massive spending to build out new data centers develop its own chips and attract new customers with improvements to the platform growth is outpacing the increased spending Moreover Amazon is currently undergoing a massive investment cycle The 75 billion in expected 2024 capital expenditures is a new record for the company Its likely to increase further in 2025 But eventually that spending will plateau At that point Amazon will reap what its sown across AWS its logistics network and its ecommerce business which fuels its advertising business That cycle has played out multiple times for Amazon over the last 30 years Historically Amazon has traded around 50 times free cash flow At that multiple it would be worth 5 trillion once it produces 100 billion in free cash flow That may happen sooner than investors expect given the strong growth in free cash flow looks poised to continue soaring through the end of the decade Before you buy stock in Amazon consider this The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are

contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media Recently Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025 Unsurprisingly many of his choices are among the Magnificent Seven Below Ill explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist Tesla NASDAQ TSLA is probably the most interesting name on Ives list For much of 2024 shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market But beginning in early November shares started going parabolic All told Tesla stock gained 62 in 2024 nearly triple that of the SP 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite The catalyst that fueled Teslas rebound The outcome of the US presidential election During the final months of Donald Trumps campaign Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate Following Trumps victory in early November Ives made it clear that he sees Musks relationship with the presidentelect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla Specifically Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fasttrack Teslas autonomous driving and robotaxi plans While I think Ives outlook makes sense its important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Teslas share price following the election results Is it really surprising to see Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA listed as a top idea for 2025 Last year Nvidia was the topperforming Magnificent Seven stock with shares climbing 171 and the companys valuation gaining more than 2 trillion Despite this unprecedented move Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling This year Nvidias biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup known as Blackwell With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidias new architecture 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader With a 4 trillion valuation within reach investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business I see Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech Over the last two years the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI the developer of ChatGPT Microsoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon Alphabet and Oracle Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit In addition Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AIs next big megatrends agentic AI The companys agentic AI virtual assistant called CoPilot is used by almost 70 of the Fortune 500 To me Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors While Ives has remained bullish on Apple NASDAQ AAPL for some time I have my concerns According to Ives Apples new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense I question how it will play out in reality Apple was late to the AI game and Im not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones Remember Apples consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury If your old iPhone is still manageable Apples AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a highercost device While Id love to be proven wrong on this one Apple is the one stock on this list that Im hesitant about right now To me Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks Ive explored Similar to Microsoft Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AIpowered services from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools advertising streaming consumer hardware and more Alphabet is an extremely diversified business and the companys revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction Yet despite the companys impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities Alphabet only trades at a forward pricetoearnings PE multiple of 219 thats lower than the average forward PE of the SP 500 I think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok While I understand these concerns in theory I think Alphabets financial results depicted above speak for themselves To me an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for longterm investors to buy the stock hand over fist Ever feel like you

access your portfolio","Tip Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results The artificial intelligence AI trend has given big boosts to the share prices of Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing NYSE TSM over the past year The two chipmakers stocks rose by 204 and 121 respectively during the period crushing the 35 gains recorded by the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index The massive demand for powerful chips capable of handling AI workloads in data centers has played a central role in driving those share price gains with major cloud service companies and governments deploying large quantities of the AIspecific semiconductors designed by Nvidia and manufactured by Taiwan Semi Market research firm Gartner estimates that global public cloud spending grew by 192 in 2024 and forecasts that it will grow at a faster pace of 215 in 2025 Evidence that cloud spending will get stronger in 2025 has already started emerging In a blog post earlier this month Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Vice Chairman and President Brad Smith said the company is on track to invest approximately 80 billion to build out AIenabled datacenters to train AI models and deploy AI and cloudbased applications around the world This news points toward a solid year for Nvidia and TSMC When Microsoft released its results for its fiscal 2025 first quarter which ended Sept 30 the company revealed that it had made capital expenditures of 149 billion on property plant and equipment As such its plan points toward a higher level of quarterly capex spending around 22 billion on average for the rest of the fiscal year For comparison Microsofts total capital expenditure stood at 557 billion in fiscal 2024 so its capex is on track to increase by more than 43 The tech giant has made it clear that the money will go toward building AI data centers So Microsofts demand for the AI chips that Nvidia designs and TSMC manufactures should continue to rise in 2025 Microsoft however wont be the only company significantly increasing its capital outlays for AI infrastructure Meta Platforms for example is expected to report total 2024 capital expenses in the range of 38 billion to 40 billion but its planning for significant growth on that front in 2025 In all the combined spending of major cloud computing players Microsoft Meta Amazon and Alphabet could reach 300 billion in 2025 from around 200 billion in 2024 according to estimates from Morgan Stanley The addressable market for AI chips is set to expand considerably this year More importantly there is a good chance that both of these semiconductor giants will be able to meet the terrific demand from the major cloud providers Thats because Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently remarked that the tech giant isnt constrained for AI chip supply anymore Thats not surprising During Nvidias November earnings conference call CFO Colette Kress said that in the current fiscal quarter the company is on track to exceed our previous Blackwell revenue estimate of several billion dollars as our visibility into supply continues to increase What this means is that Nvidia is producing more of its nextgeneration Blackwell processors than it was originally anticipating The reason why Nvidia now has greater visibility into its supply chain is because its foundry partner TSMC has been significantly increasing its AI chip production capacity TSMC is expected to double its advanced chip packaging capacity in 2025 to 75000 wafers a month Moreover Nvidia has reportedly been allocated 60 of this increased capacity this year So Nvidia and TSMC are in a solid position to make the most of the impressive increase in capital spending by the major cloud providers discussed above Analysts are expecting Nvidias earnings to increase by 50 in its fiscal 2026 which will begin in February to 443 per share TSMCs earnings on the other hand are expected to jump by 28 in 2025 to 906 per share However the combination of increased capital spending by cloud service providers on AI data centers along with Nvidia and TSMCs focus on quickly adding capacity to serve that high and growing demand should set them up for another year of terrific gains that may surpass Wall Streets current expectations Before you buy stock in Nvidia consider this The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they

There is no generally accepted definition of cheap stocks You can use that term for those with low share prices for investments that seem to be worth more than Wall Streets asking price and for smallcap companies that might look like affordable buyouts to a larger business You can even apply it to stocks that have fallen far below an earlier pricing peak or to shares with exorbitantly rich dividend yields But some definitions are more useful than others Today Im looking at a couple of tech stocks with the investorfriendly quality of trading at modest valuation ratios despite fantastic longterm prospects This is my favorite definition of cheapness on Wall Street because finding these stocks can make you a lot of money over time You know what they almost say Buy low hold on for many years sell high Getting in at a deepdiscount stock price is a great way to start that moneymaking process So let me show you why I think Roku NASDAQ ROKU and Fiverr International NYSE FVRR fit that description in January 2025 You might recognize these two names as stars of the coronavirus pandemics era of lockdowns and remote work Stuck at home with limited access to other entertainment options millions of people started watching movies and TV shows through streaming media services often via Rokupowered devices Others and in many cases the same people suddenly had time on their hands to pursue online freelancing Fiverr was happy to help with connecting these idle experts in various fields to companies and other people who needed their services So Fiverr and Roku soared in 2020 and 2021 but crashed hard when their customers went back to office work Keep in mind that Im talking about their stocks here not their sales The businesses continued to thrive long after investors started to write them off as temporary COVID19 winners Its true that Fiverr and Roku experienced slower sales growth in 2022 and a brief period of stalled success in 2023 But thats hardly a unique story as consumers around the world changed their spending habits in response to soaring inflation Business powerhouses like Apple and Microsoft were undermined by the same personalbudget effects and with worse results Roku and Fiverr have doubled their annual sales since 2020 while Microsofts topline growth stopped at 66 and Apples was 33 Yet the marketdarling tech giants nearly doubled their stock prices while my freelancing and mediastreaming heroes crashed And Im not worried about Rokus or Fiverrs weak earnings which were often printed in red ink in recent years The companies are still generating healthy free cash flows which makes me think of their low or negative earnings as an effective taxreduction strategy In early 2025 Rokus stock is changing hands at 31 times sales The company is building on its North American market dominance with the beginnings of an international growth strategy and its adbased sales should soon soar again Ad buyers will probably flock to its costeffective ad spots as the aftereffects of the inflation panic are fading out Fiverrs pricetosales ratio sits just below Rokus and the stock is worth just 12 times estimated earnings in 2025 You can also look at its affordable pricetofreecashflow ratio which stops at 145 Based on these metrics Fiverrs stock could double in price and still look cheap next to Microsoft or Apple With expanded operations like a recently launched hub for nonprofit services the company is monetizing its freelancinggig platform in new ways There you have it The future looks bright for these forgotten tech

computing behemoth Amazon NASDAQ AMZN rallied 444 in 2024 according to data from SP Global Market Intelligence Like most of the Magnificent Seven Amazon had a great 2024 as investors piled into largecap technology stocks participating in the artificial intelligence AI revolution But Amazon had also entered the year with some big questions hanging over it as investors wondered whether it had fallen behind rivals in the AI race Yet over the course of the year Amazon put many of those concerns to rest Coming into 2024 some thought Amazon was caught late to the AI game After all cloud rival Microsoft invested early in OpenAI the company behind ChatGPT which appeared to give Microsoft the early lead in AI cloud workloads But did anyone think Amazon of all companies would take this lying down Since 2023 Amazon has gotten to work on its own AI cloud services First leveraging its size as the largest cloud provider heading into the AI revolution Amazon rolled out its Bedrock cloud services in mid2023 Amazon Bedrock offers a variety of competing thirdparty large language models for developers giving perhaps the most diversified AI tool portfolio of any cloud provider Additionally in late 2023 Amazon invested in OpenAI rival Anthropic which is run by OpenAIs exvice president of research Dario Amodei and is available on Bedrock Amazon then followed up that initial investment with two more investments in Anthropic in 2024 Amazons latest investment in November amounted to 4 billion bringing its total investment in Anthropic to 8 billion In conjunction with that investment Anthropic agreed to use AWS as its primary cloud provider and training partner while also committing to use Amazons Trainium and Inferentia chips to train and run its future AI models The collaboration appeared to both validate Anthropic as a key player in the AI races and a serious OpenAI competitor while also validating Amazons inhouse chips as worthy tools against the current AI training standard of expensive Nvidia GPUs But it wasnt just press releases and investments that drove Amazon higher positive financial results did too AWS revenue growth accelerated 19 in the third quarter up from 12 a year earlier And perhaps just as important the segments operating margin expanded from 303 to 381 over that same period Not to be outdone or forgotten Amazons ecommerce segment also picked up the pace and expanded margins too Amazons North America and International ecommerce empires continued their solid growth in the highsingledigits and lowdoubledigits respectively Meanwhile North America ecommerce operating margins expanded by a full percentage point from 49 to 59 while the International business expanded margins from 03 to a positive 36 margin over the past year Amazon spent the past couple of years cutting costs and transitioning to a regional delivery system in its ecommerce business and this years rapid margin expansion appears to show those efforts paying off Amazon has demonstrated resilience in the face of several bear markets and recessions over its corporate life After a difficult postpandemic slowdown the past years improvements show Amazons management culture to be as smart and resilient as its ever been even following the 2021 retirement of founder Jeff Bezos While the stock cant be considered cheap at 35 times this years earnings expectations Amazon has always appeared expensive to many as it has long prioritized longterm thinking over shortterm profits That being said the companys ability to expand profit margins this year after the rapid rise in interest rates since 2022 speaks volumes about Amazons dynamism With this commitment to both innovation and longterm returns on investments Amazon remains a solid

company at the right price you can gain well over 100 For instance the price of Microsoft Corporation NASDAQMSFT stock is up an impressive 151 over the last five years The last week saw the share price soften some 10 With that in mind its worth seeing if the companys underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance or if there are some discrepancies See our latest analysis for Microsoft While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism share prices reflect investor sentiment not just underlying business performance One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a companys share price and its earnings per share EPS Over half a decade Microsoft managed to grow its earnings per share at 18 a year This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 20 average annual increase in the share price This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal Rather the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time unveil the exact values by clicking on the image We know that Microsoft has improved its bottom line lately but is it going to grow revenue If youre interested you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts It is important to consider the total shareholder return as well as the share price return for any given stock The TSR incorporates the value of any spinoffs or discounted capital raisings along with any dividends based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested So for companies that pay a generous dividend the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return We note that for Microsoft the TSR over the last 5 years was 162 which is better than the share price return mentioned above The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return Microsoft provided a TSR of 87 over the last twelve months But that was short of the market average Its probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 21 over five years Its quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess even as the share price gains are slowing I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance But to truly gain insight we

cash which Buffett and his team can deploy when they find new opportunities Since Buffett became CEO in 1965 Berkshire stock has delivered a compound annual return of 198 crushing the average annual gain of 104 in the SP 500 SNPINDEX GSPC over the same period Buffett is a fulltime investing professional so he knows that the average retail investor would struggle to replicate his success Thats why he often recommends they buy exchangetraded funds ETFs instead of picking individual stocks Berkshire actually holds two of them in its portfolio The Vanguard SP 500 ETF NYSEMKT VOO and the SPDR SP 500 ETF Trust NYSEMKT SPY Both funds directly track the performance of the SP 500 and according to a recent forecast by a top Wall Street analyst investors who buy either of them today could earn a 153 gain by 2030 The SP 500 is the most diversified of the major US stock market indexes It features 500 companies from 11 different sectors of the economy and it has very strict entry criteria To qualify for inclusion companies must have a market capitalization of at least 205 billion and they must be profitable over the most recent 12month period Even then a special committee meets once per quarter to decide which companies will make the cut ensuring only the highestquality names are included The Vanguard SP 500 ETF and the SPDR SP 500 ETF Trust track the performance of the SP 500 by holding the same stocks and maintaining similar weightings They are practically identical except for their expense ratios which measure the proportion of each fund deducted every year to cover management costs The Vanguard SP 500 ETF has an expense ratio of just 003 so a 10000 investment will incur annual fees of 3 The SPDR SP 500 ETF Trust on the other hand has a slightly higher expense ratio of 00945 meaning a 10000 investment will incur annual fees of 945 The difference is negligible over the long term but it might be a good enough reason to pick the Vanguard ETF especially if youre investing a large sum of money The information technology sector is the largest in the SP 500 representing 329 of its total value Thats because the index is weighted by market capitalization which means its largest holdings have a greater influence over its performance than the smallest Apple Nvidia and Microsoft each have a market cap of over 3 trillion making them the largest companies in the world As a result they are the top three holdings in the SP 500 and they all happen to be in the information technology sector Stock SP 500 Weighting 1 Apple 732 2 Nvidia 724 3 Microsoft 629 Data source State Street Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Jan 6 and are subject to change But the SP 500 isnt all about technology even Buffetts own Berkshire Hathaway is among its top 10 holdings Investors will also find the worlds largest investment bank JPMorgan Chase in the index as well as Visa Costco Wholesale Walmart CocaCola and more Investors should never make decisions based solely on the word of Wall Street analysts because they dont always get things right But Tom Lee from Fundstrat Global Advisors made some very accurate predictions for the SP 500 over the last two years so its worth paying attention to his forecasts He predicted that the index would hit 4750 in 2023 when most other analysts were cautious and it closed the year at 4769 The SP 500 also surpassed four of his price targets in 2024 5200 5500 5700 and 6000 But he is human he swung for the fences one last time in December by predicting that the index could hit 6300 by yearend which didnt quite work out Lee also issued a longterm forecast for the SP 500 last year He thinks the index will climb to 15000 by 2030 which implies an upside of 153 from where it trades as of this writing Thats the return investors can expect from the Vanguard SP 500 ETF and the SDPR SP 500 ETF Trust if hes right Lee believes that artificial intelligence AI will contribute to the upside because companies could pour trillions of dollars into subsegments like machine learning and automation to solve global workforce shortages over the next few years He also says that millennials and Gen Zers are about to enter the prime period of their careers between the ages of 30 and 50 which is when people earn the most money and make major life decisions like investing That could be a tailwind for the SP 500 But every forecast comes with risks AI could fail to live up to expectations causing companies like Nvidia and Microsoft to lose significant amounts of value which would be a drag on the SP 500 A deep economic recession or even another pandemic could also disrupt the index on its journey to 15000 adding years to Lees target timeframe With that said history suggests that the SP 500 is likely to reach 15000 eventually Even if it doesnt happen by 2030 investors probably wont regret taking Buffetts advice by buying the Vanguard SP 500 ETF or SPDR SP 500 ETF Trust today Before you buy stock in

symbol or a specific company name for relevant results Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT made headlines late last week when it announced it would spend 80 billion this year building data centers that would train artificial intelligence AI models and handle AI and cloudbased applications around the world More than half of the investment will be in the US To put the amount Microsoft is spending on AI infrastructure in perspective that is more than the gross domestic product GDP of many countries including Croatia and Lithuania to name just two Microsofts Azure cloud has been a big AI winner with the unit growing its revenue by 33 year over year last quarter and Azure OpenAI use doubling in the last six months However the company has said growth could be even greater if it were not for capacity constraints as demand for its AI services has outstripped capacity There were certainly clues that the company was about to go on a big building spree in data centers it had 1087 billion in finance leases for data centers whose construction had not yet commenced These leases were set to go into effect between fiscal 2025 and 2030 with lease terms from one to 20 years I think Microsoft will benefit from its increased data center spending given the strong demand its cloud business is seeing And I believe Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA will be the ultimate winner from this spending Not all of that 80 billion will go toward graphics processing units GPUs and AI accelerator chips Nvidia specialties but a significant portion will For perspective for its fiscal 2024 ended in June Microsoft had 445 billion in capital expenditures capex most of which went toward data centers and cloud computing The company has said that about half of its capex goes toward assets with long practical lives while the other half goes toward central processing unit CPU and GPU servers Microsoft was Nvidias largest customer in 2024 buying a reported 485000 of its GPUs more than twice the amount of its secondlargest customer Meta Platforms Taken all together it looks like Nvidias largest customer is about to spend significantly more on GPUs in 2025 than it did in 2024 a huge win for the company Even more so Microsofts finance leases that have not yet commenced still indicate that it does not plan on stopping its data center spending this year If 40 billion of its capex is going toward longlife assets like leases that means less than half of those leases will commence this year In addition the announcement of the huge spending spree could very well spur more AI infrastructure spending from other Nvidia customers Large tech companies such as Alphabet and Meta Platforms have both stressed the importance of AI and how the biggest risk is underspending not overspending Meanwhile I think it is safe to say there are some pretty big egos in the tech world and many execs want to win the AI race As such I wouldnt be surprised to see other large hyperscalers companies with huge data center operations also ramp up spending Nvidia remains the king of GPUs holding about a 90 market share in the space Its CUDA software platform which lets developers program its chips for different tasks has proved to be a big differentiator and created a wide moat for the company With competitor Advanced Micro Devices still trailing behind with its software Nvidia looks poised to continue to be the biggest AI infrastructure winner The companys toughest competition may come from custom AI chips that companies like Broadcom and Marvell Technology help clients develop These chips are designed to perform very specific tasks and thus can perform them better than GPUs which have more flexibility But these chips are also customerspecific And for mass deployment at scale Nvidia and its GPUs are still the quickest and easiest ways to build out large AI infrastructure projects and as such will continue to hold a large market share Nvidia still has a large opportunity with companies continuing to pour money into AI infrastructure The fact that its largest customer is greatly ramping up its investment in this area is a great sign that the chipmaker will continue to see outsize growth in 2025 Nvidias stock continues to trade at an attractive valuation with a forward pricetoearnings ratio PE of only about 314 based on 2025 analyst estimates and a priceearningstogrowth ratio PEG of 098 A PEG below 1 is generally view as undervalued and growth stocks will often command PEGs well above 1 With the company looking to be the biggest beneficiary of Microsofts 80 billion data center buildout and

of Constellation Energy NASDAQ CEG manage to climb 91 according to numbers from SP Global Market Intelligence in calendar 2024 In retrospect the reason isnt really all that surprising Although this utility giants stock made respectable forward progress all year long the bulk of the big gain materialized in two brilliant bullish bursts The first of these bursts came in February in response to guidance for the year ahead Fueled by strong pricing guarantees for electricity generated by its fleet of nuclear reactors the company offered 2024 earnings guidance that was measurably ahead of expectations More to the point the outlook suggested Constellation would be able to keep the impact of inflation in check for the foreseeable future supporting its annual earnings growth target of 10 The other bullish surge took shape in September after announcing it would be restarting one of the dormant nuclear reactors at Harrisburg Pennsylvanias Three Mile Island in order to meet the power needs of one of Microsofts many data centers Although this restart is still years away the development could mark the beginning of a more sweeping movement that plays into Constellations strength as a nuclear power producer Its the nations leading producer of nuclear power in fact accounting for more than 80 of its total annual energy output Its sheer size helps it remain costeffective And this is no small detail While the growing availability of renewable energy is certainly helping accelerate the decline in the use of fossil fuels the need for new production capacity is outpacing the growth of renewables To this end the US Department of Energy is planning for a tripling of the nations current nuclear power output to 200 gigawatts by 2050 Recognizing this particular utility outfit is

into the Azure OpenAI Service Microsofts fully managed service powered by ChatGPT maker OpenAIs technologies In the complaint Microsoft accuses the defendants who it refers to only as Does a legal pseudonym of violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and a federal racketeering law by illicitly accessing and using Microsofts software and servers for the purpose to create offensive and harmful and illicit content Microsoft did not provide specific details about the abusive content that was generated The company is seeking injunctive and other

to authenticate an app or user were being used to generate content that violates the services acceptable use policy Subsequently through an investigation Microsoft discovered that the API keys had been stolen from paying customers according to the complaint The precise manner in which Defendants obtained all of the API Keys used to carry out the misconduct described in this Complaint is unknown Microsofts complaint reads but it appears that Defendants have engaged in a pattern of systematic API Key theft that enabled them to steal Microsoft API Keys from multiple Microsoft customers Microsoft alleges that the defendants used stolen Azure OpenAI Service API keys belonging to USbased customers to create a hackingasaservice scheme Per the complaint to pull off this scheme the defendants created a clientside tool called de3u as well as software for processing and routing communications from de3u to Microsofts systems De3u allowed users to leverage stolen API keys to generate images using DALLE one of the OpenAI models available to Azure OpenAI Service customers without having to write their own code Microsoft alleges De3u also attempted to prevent the Azure

repo containing de3u project code hosted on GitHub a company that Microsoft owns is no longer accessible at press time These features combined with Defendants unlawful programmatic API access to the

going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation NASDAQMSFT stands against other stocks ahead of major AI event that Jim Cramer discussed In his appearance on Squawk on the Street the day CES took place in Las Vegas Jim Cramer commented on the stock market division that persisted throughout 2024 and is present in 2025 as well The division has seen technology stocks perform well while other ratesensitive sectors such as industrial and materials stocks have languished Cramer commented on the reasons behind it I think thats because people perceive that the rest of the market is hostage to rates And that tech is not hostage to anything So Im aware of that and Im just concerned that you have this speech tonight ninethirty Jensen Huang everyones were really kind of whatever he says is going to move things In fact this division is so prevalent that some of the biggest asset managers in the world have also been unable to remain immune to it Mentioning a piece in the Financial Times Cramer shared that it commented about private equity and private equity trying to get into the 401k business He added and mentioned Marc Rowan CEO of Apollo says I jokingly say sometimes we levered the entire retirement inaudible to NVIDIAs performance So inaudible weve got the NVIDIAs of the world which everybody likes and on the other hand theres these stocks are they really are hostage to rates and no one wants them However even though technology stocks have stood the test of high interest rates they might falter in some circumstances One of these can be bond yields and if the thirtyyear yield spikes to 5 then Cramer believes that will start interfering with this tech rally that seems to be motivated by a lot of analysts coming out and saying this is the time theres now reacceleration in tech spend The CNBC host also speculated on what Jensen Huang might end up talking about at CES later in the day He stated I think that one of the things that Jensen is going to talk about today are all the new use cases This is tonights CES talk It wouldnt surprise me if we start hearing about robots It wouldnt surprise me if we didnt hear a lot about Tesla Tesla and selfdriving cars Tesla and the neural network that is based on NVIDIA Along with industrial and material stocks another sector thats caught Cramers attention is banks Mentioning a recent investment bank note about the sector he believes that one of the groups that I think we have to focus on theres a really interesting uh Barclays piece on the banks Darkest before dawn Raising the group for the first time since 2019 emphasis here on Citi Cramer also outlined that while technology valuations might appear to be overstretched this isnt the case with banks He shared This is a group that when you look at it theyre selling at 11 times 2026 numbers So the idea that you have this valuation problem in the market well look at these stocks Theres no valuation problem with materials Or with banks He added The valuation problem is with the stuff that keeps getting upgraded which is enterprise software So theres a little duplicitous nature among the top people who work at these firms because they should be saying look there are two markets Theres the inexpensive market and were warming up to it and the expensive market and we dont know what to do To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBCs Squawk on the Street aired on Monday For these stocks we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in The reason is simple our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds Our quarterly newsletters

Microsoft Corporation NASDAQMSFTs vice chair and president Brad Smith Brad Smiths his blog entry its really much more than that Hes talking about an AI manifesto And the reason why I say its important is cause a lot of people say listen hes talking about 80 billion in spend so what No hes not Hes talking about the new industrial revolution Which is what you should be hearing tonight from Jensen The new industrial revolution is such that you cant afford to not spend Not because youre worried about what other people are doing but because its so bountiful Overall MSFT ranks 1st on our list of

player in the PC market and it proved its on its way with the release of its latest Snapdragon X chip Available in midrange laptops priced at roughly 600 the Snapdragon X is designed to provide consumers with the power to run ondevice AI applications and features without having to break the bank But the company isnt content with simply taking on the likes of AMD AMD and Intel INTC in the laptop space It has also launched new mini desktop computers with partner Lenovo geared toward consumers and enterprise customers And during an interview with Yahoo Finance CEO Cristiano Amon hinted that the chip giant has more up its sleeve in the coming months We want to be able to have a portfolio that can go into every price point with a Copilot PC Amon said outside Qualcomms booth on the CES showroom floor in Las Vegas Were not stopping here Were just starting with that portfolio of products In particular Amon said Qualcomm is looking to expand into the highperformance PC graphics market something that would put the company into direct competition with heavyweight Nvidia NVDA Qualcomm isnt new to the PC space The company previously attempted to break into the market with chips designed for Windows 10 laptops but the effort never gained any traction due to compatibility issues with Windows apps But things are different this time around Reviews of laptops running on Qualcomms Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips are generally positive with reviewers pointing to impressive performance and longlasting batteries that you dont find on AMD or Intelpowered systems Qualcomm is also working with Microsoft MSFT to ensure that apps designed to run on AMD and Intels chips can run on Qualcomms So far the companies are doing well enough at the task In my own testing Microsofts Snapdragonpowered Surface Laptop provided exceptional battery life and plenty of performance power and didnt suffer from any app compatibility issues Gaming however is a different story Gamers require serious processing and graphics power and while the Snapdragon X Elite is a strong chip gamers especially desktop gamers will be looking for dedicated graphics chips that can run their favorite titles Its unclear whether Qualcomm is even angling to hit that particular space Amon could simply mean the company is working on chips with more powerful integrated graphics chips built into its Snapdragon line of processors If it is looking to get into the dedicated graphics space however it would mean having to tangle with Nvidia which controls a staggering 88 of the desktop graphics space alone according to Toms Hardware If taking on Nvidia isnt enough Qualcomms entire PC effort relies on stealing share from AMD and Intel and thats a tall task According to Mercury Research via Toms Hardware Intel still controls some 76 of the PC market but the companys recent struggles related to its massive turnaround effort including the ouster of CEO Pat Gelsinger give Qualcomm an opportunity to take market share from the chip behemoth AMD isnt resting on its laurels either The company is similarly looking to capture greater market share from its archrival and is doing so by leaning heavily on AI PCs and gaming For his part Amon said Qualcomms growth has little to do with its competitors struggles and everything to do with its own efforts The incredible traction youre seeing right now is just because we develop a very competitive platform independent of what our competitors were doing Amon said Were just starting Well continue to have a roadmap of products and we will be pushing the

leaders in the world Gates cofounded Microsoft and was its CEO through its most rapid growth years in the 80s and 90s as Microsoft came to dominate the market for PC operating systems and productivity software in its Office suite positions it still enjoys today Gates stepped down from the leadership post in 2000 and resigned as chairman of the board in 2014 Since then he has devoted himself to philanthropy through the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation but he is still one of the richest people in the world with a net worth of 103 billion Much of that wealth is held in the foundation which has 45 billion in assets under management Gates doesnt directly manage the endowment a task given to Cascade Management Company but he does oversee it as a trustee Not surprisingly the trusts top holding is Microsoft while the secondlargest is Berkshire Hathaway whose CEO Warren Buffett is a close friend and associate of Gates The fund is largely made up of safe blue chip stocks like those two but the Gates Trust purchased two stocks in the third quarter that show a clear directional bet heading into 2025 In the third quarter the foundation trust added 1 million shares each of FedEx NYSE FDX and Paccar NASDAQ PCAR two highly cyclical stocks for roughly 215 million and 100 million respectively FedEx is seen as a bellwether for the global economy as the company is a global leader in package delivery and lessthantruckload LTL logistics while Paccar is one of the biggest truck manufacturers in the world and owns brands like Kenworth and Peterbilt Trucking and transportation is a highly cyclical business as demand is closely correlated with economic growth When the economy expands it generally means businesses and consumers need more materials and products Conversely in a recession they tend to cut back leading to lower demand for trucking and transportation services Gates hasnt commented on the purchases of FedEx or Paccar but the buys signal a bullish stance on the transportation sector and the greater economy in 2025 Lower interest rates and the potential impact of various Trump policies could stimulate the sector this year Potential policy impacts include tariff threats accelerating imports and corporate tax cuts or bonus depreciation that could free up capital to invest or spend on transportation Some industry insiders have observed a normalization in freight economics between carriers and shippers and pronounced an end to the freight recession One other stock that looks set to win on a transportation recovery is XPO NYSE XPO the thirdlargest LTL carrier in North America behind FedEx and Old Dominion Freight Lines XPO has already delivered impressive results in a market with little volume growth so industry tailwinds could propel it even further in 2025 The company which has spun off GXO Logistics and the RXO truck brokerage to focus on North American LTL has been able to achieve price increases through customer improvements in ontime and damage claims Cost efficiencies along with higher prices have boosted the companys operating ratio a key industry metric that is the inverse of operating margin In the third quarter the North American operating ratio fell from 862 to 842 and the company is making progress on lowering it to 81 by 2027 Yield or pricing was up 67 which drove adjusted earnings per share EPS up 16 to 102 XPO also has a number of competitive advantages including that its the only freight company that can manufacture its own trailers allowing it to scale up in an expansion have better and more costefficient control of its fleet and make repairs as needed It also owns its own driving school allowing it to develop its own source of labor The company is expanding by adding new terminals capitalizing on the earlier bankruptcy of rival Yellow which will grow its customer base and make it more appealing to existing customers Its also developed technology to improve ontime rates give shippers realtime visibility and improve trailer utilization and safety XPO may seem expensive at a pricetoearnings ratio of 44 but the LTL business has a lot of leverage as margins can swing wildly with changes in capacity and demand and profit margins could expand rapidly under the right circumstances After gaining 65 over the last year the stock has more room to run in a bullish environment for transportation

Double Down stocks Stock Advisor returns as of January 6 2025 This video was recorded on Jan 03 2025 Dylan Lewis Whats AGI Well know when we see dollar signs This weeks Motley Fool Money radio show starts now Everybody needs money Thats why they call it money Its the Motley Fool Money Radio Show Im Dylan Lewis Joining me over the Airwaves Motley Fool senior analysts Bill Mann and Asit Sharma Fools great to have you both with me here to welcome in 2025 Bill Mann How are you doing Dylan Happy New Year Dylan Lewis Happy New Year to both of you guys Im excited Its nice to be back feel a little restored feel a little refreshed after the holiday break Were going to pick up exactly where we left off in 2024 AI was in focus last year Were focusing on it in 2025 Its not going anywhere Two incredibly interesting stories that I wanted to dive into right away with you guys kickoff the Year First up Microsoft and ChatGPT Maker OpenAI have a very welldocumented partnership There are reports out this week detailing some of the more finer elements of their agreement including how theyve defined the Holy grail of AI borrowing from Supreme Court Justice Potters Stewart Bill I know it when I see it hit 100 billion in profits I feel like this is not the highly technical definition we were expecting Bill Mann In the terminator SkyNet became selfaware on August 29 2024 and thats a pretty exciting definition of AGI This one is so much more boring but it does in fact fall from the fact that Microsoft has invested in OpenAI when OpenAI was and is a nonprofit You have to put some definition that is a little bit different than what you would have with a forprofit company investing in a forprofit company They apparently did like a little Yelta conference and decide that its 100 billion in profits which sounds like a long way away because OpenAI is expected to accumulate losses of about 44 billion between 2023 and 2028 but it could change very quickly They are simply putting bounds around what happens when it changes Dylan Lewis Asit I feel like so much of the conversation with AI has focused on development and whether it can pass the Turing test and all of these more noble technical ideas How do you feel about money being the milestone marker here Asit Sharma Well I think its entirely appropriate in one sense I think SatnaNd is saying to get to 100 billion in profits annually were going to need AGI to be able to turn that much money No one else has been able to figure it out except for monopoly like operations like Saudi Aramco or big conglomerates like Berkshire Hathaway In some ways this makes sense Now cynically you could also say this has some bit of sunk cost fallacy in it perhaps Microsoft is waking up to these losses and trying to up the anti to recoup their investment Some could chalk this up to in for a penny in for a pound We have billions tens of billions to invest Lets take a moonshot here I think what we will find with OpenAI is theyll probably revise this agreement or definition in a few years to something thats more tenable but it does spur both parties to try to make some progress Bill Mann Putting the number around it if you think what 100 billion is on their website OpenAI defines AGI as a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically viable work which in some ways is way more scary to me than 100 billion laughs in profit Dylan Lewis I think we have to also note here 100 billion is not some arbitrary number or AGI is not some arbitrary milestone I should say When Microsoft and OpenAI originally contracted their relationship part of the deal was OpenAI will be free of Microsoft if they hit AGI That was a term in the contract that they had set up If youre a Microsoft shareholder Bill are you rooting for AGI here or are you rooting for this very prolonged development process where Microsoft continues to be very closely knit with OpenAI Bill Mann Well Microsoft is a three trillion dollar company and so in some ways these numbers are shockingly small for them but Microsoft has a 13 billion investment in OpenAI in their for profit subsidiary Yes they would like to be able to recoup and a 44 billion cumulative loss over a fiveyear period is not for an investor I would describe maybe the technical term is not great Dylan Lewis A lot of redlaughs Bill Mann Its a lot of red Thats right You would like at some point for an investment to pay off Dylan Lewis Thats the goal Thats what we try to do here Sticking with the futuristic Meta is bringing a suite of AI products to users on the platform building out its AI studio offering to help users create online personas or also AI influencers Metas VP of generative AI telling the Financial Times we expect these AIs to actually exist on our platform in the same way that accounts do like human accounts Asit did you think we would be here this fast Asit Sharma No but laughs Ive always been surprised at the rapidity which certain social platforms grow and explode I guess this is no different when you throw AI into the mix Whats important here to note from Metas perspective is that humans have such a narcissistic bent in some ways and we want to share so much about our lives Theyre putting their finger on just an amazing pulse of human tendency which is to say hey look at this Now being able to have AI avatars or AI influencers just completely made up things that you or I could direct or create makes so much sense for Meta on an economic level because this requires an amazing amount of compute If they get hundreds of millions of kids using this system thats a lot of money that will accrue to Meta They have every reason to want to promote this Although the societal effects do we want to even go there Dylan Lewis In some ways this is a blend of Meta saying we think this is where the world is going but also where we have seen people already go Independently there are agencies that have built AI influencers They are receiving money from fans They are also inking brand deals Bill if youre an advertiser are you hopping into the AI influencer economy Bill Mann I think that you have to play there Whenever I hear these conversations Im always mindful of Bill Gates saying in the 70s that he did not believe that every home would need a personal computer We have an idea of social media now because it is how we have used it What these types of devices will do will alter it and will create experiences that we really cant conceive of now even the creators and the advertisers who look to benefit from this cant really conceive of where this is going but theyve got to play in it They have to be in that sandbox Dylan Lewis Asit you offered a cynical take earlier when we were talking about that Open AI story Im going to put one up here and I want you to react to it about this Meta story At the end of the day advertisers and social media companies want eyeballs They want time They want attention and anything in service of that will work as long as it converts What do you think of that Asit Sharma I think thats the way the advertising world works Let me be noncynical for a moment laughs I think there is a way that all of this evolves because we inevitably will have a reaction at some point in time after this peaks where people want to go back to more human experiences Were seeing this in smaller variations all over the AI experience and that will force advertisers to come up with maybe something less homogeneous less pure 100 all on AI A hybrid mix is what Im indicating of a human and an AI experience Maybe I dont know Youre picturing a car where a human influencer is driving down the street with their AI in the passenger seat Im headed back to heading back to the cynical part here laughs Let me stop while Im behind Bill Mann It does feel like our robot overlords are setting up for a pretty good 2025 Dylan Lewis You opened the 2025 radio show talking about SkyNet Bill Where do you think we were going to go today show No more SkyNet ahead but plenty more Motley for Money Well be back In just a minute to raise a glass to President Jimmy Carter and how he opened up one of my favorite industries thatll be coming up after the break Stay right here Youre listening to Motley For Money Welcome back to Motley Fool Money Im Dylan Lewis Here on air with Bill Mann and Asit Sharma Before the end of 2024 we lost President Jimmy Carter after a long and impressive life as a public servant and humanitarian Bill Carter is known for so many things but this week you wanted to zoom in on a very specific part of his legacy Bill Mann Its funny because Jimmy Carter was a teetotaler his entire life and yet he can singlehandedlyy be credited with changing the entire tenor of the American craft brewing industry Because after prohibition was repealed they forgot to Ill say forgot to Well give them that credit They didnt really contemplate creating rules around home brewing It just went without being conversed It was technically illegal up until 1978 in which time Jimmy Carter signed a bill that ended a prohibition on home brewing which then the Jim Cooks of the world from Boston Beer will tell you thats where the fantastic Craft Blog industry came from and got its start Dylan Lewis Ill put some numbers to that Back when Carter signed that bill there were 90 breweries in the United States That is the fewest in US history aside from prohibition which lets be real There were breweries They just werent being reported back then Bill Mann laughs Officially Dylan Lewis You go to 1998 20 years after the bill was passed there were 1500 Today there are 10000 breweries in the United States I mentioned all of this Asit because theres a point here in the way that regulations and markets can work together If you eliminate the barrier to entry some smaller players can hop in and maybe do some tasty things for consumers out in the marketplace Asit Sharma I think thats very true Innovation sometimes gets stifled by regulation This is a great case study for how coming together for a common cause that is to bring flavor into the light can be good Now I want to get off this soapbox Im starting to stand on and bring some numbers to it or one number About a year laughs That is the length of time that a beer called Billy Beer lasted in the marketplace How can we not talk about the unsung hero of this story Probably in an informal advisor to the president Jimmy Carters beloved brother Billy had his own beer It was outsourced to a local brewery out in the Midwest I think but Im sure that played a role I think some conversations between the two because Bill Carter was not a teetotaler may have helped change Jimmy Carters thinking or at least influence it to support the passage of that Bill Dylan Lewis Were in an era of revivals and franchise extensions so I would not be surprised if there was some brewer out there saying you know what Its time to bring back Billy Beer Bill Mann This actually has happened Dylan Lewis It has Bill Mann Dylan Yes it actually has happened In 2018 the Uptown brewering company in Snow Hill North Carolina began brewing Billy Beer again Dylan Lewis If youre a Billy Beer fan or a Boston Beer shareholder you owe a glass to Jimmy Carter this weekend Well be honoring Carters lifetime here in Washington DC with his state funeral on January 9th and just a headsup for investors The stock market will be closed Thursday of next week If you want to celebrate them maybe raise a glass this weekend but try to keep it to just one or two News out Friday the US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy is issuing guidance that alcoholic drinks should have warnings about alcohols ties to preventable cancer Asit this is affecting shares of AB InBev and Diageo on the news What do you make of it Asit Sharma Well first I think its not a bad thing personally because many of us dont realize that alcohol does carry cancer risk Getting that personal take out of the way Im not so sure its a big hit to major brewers and major purveyors of spirits The reason is that during the pandemic we saw a market decline in heavy consumption of alcohol among younger age groups simply because they couldnt get together and go out for those long bar nights Some of those habits have continued post pandemic Many brewers around the world and many spirits makers had to adapt with a whole class of people that just want to drink a little less Weve seen them innovate I think its Anheuser Busch which is going to have 20 of its sales that will come from nonalcoholic drinks this year in 2025 Thats just one indication of where this industry is moving Heres one more small challenge for the industry as a whole to innovate Youll see more energy drinks Youll see more tasty nonalcoholic drinks I think overall its not a dealbreaker Dylan Lewis This is the other side of the coin We were just talking about how deregulation can reduce the barriers to entry Regulation can also force creativity too Bill Bill Mann Without commenting on the merits of the surgeon generals warning on alcohol I will say this Is anybody surprised that alcohols bad for you on certain levels It is another obstacle for alcohol suppliers Its also an obstacle for the restaurant industry which is facing a number of headwinds Theres a slowdown in restaurant traffic lower consumer spending fair amount of inflation in their cost structure As Asit mentioned the younger consumers just arent drinking as much as we did I guess or do Dylan Lewis This segment will double as some added encouragement for those doing dry January Youve got this and youre doing yourself a favor here according to the surgeon general Before we head out to break I do want to get each of your takes on an investing story that you are watching for 2025 Asit Im going to start with you What is something that you have on your radar and maybe want more people to be paying attention to Asit Sharma Well Dylan over the last year weve seen a number of fintech companies companies that combine technology with finances suddenly collapse The most notable one was a company called Snaps which I think still has maybe 100 million bucks of customer money unaccounted for laughs Even here we are in the beginning of 2025 Some smaller companies as well one by the name of Tally the information which is a great resource for learning about Silicon Valley just reported two more Fintech closures abrupt closures in the past two weeks What I want to point out here and maybe cue folks into is that when you place your money with a Fintech app and it says that its FDIC insured because it has a relationship with a bank Thats not always the case Many of these companies are simply intermediaries and its being really dragged out in court in some cases who has the responsibility for your account Just something that Im following as a news story as an investing story but also a cautionary tale If your bank is one that offers you maybe 4 on your money thats not laughs a bad place to park it I do embrace the spirit of innovation as weve been talking about I have some Fintech apps that I use myself but buyer beware do your due diligence before you place your funds anywhere Dylan Lewis Bill what about you Do you have a cautionary note for investors as well Bill Mann Cautionary I guess I would say in one way The US stock market has outperformed every other global market for really good reason over the last call it decade If youre holding US equities today as a starting point were at a cyclically adjusted PE of the market in the high 30s You just have to recognize that historically you are expecting an awful lot of the market especially by one thats dominated by so few companies especially by one thats added several trillion dollars in market capitalization to those companies I want to talk about that but really thats boring What I really want to talk about is I want to know at the end of 2025 how much fart coins going to be worth Dylan Lewis We will check back in at the end of 2025 and see I think its going to be worth less if I take a guess Bill Asit well see you guys a little bit later in the show Up next weve got Motley Fool CEO Tom Gardner talking through his favorite metric and what its saying about the state of the market for 2025 Stay right here Youre listening to Motley Fool Money Welcome back to Motley Fool Money Im Dylan Lewis New Year new financial plan This time of year a lot of people start revisiting their portfolios and household finances as part of the big resolution swing Ahead of the New Year Motley Fool CEO Tom Gardner walked our Motley Fool members through his 2025 investing playbook in a bonus episode of our premium podcast Stock Advisor Round Table Tom and one of my colleagues Laurine Horse talk through the tried and true principles that govern how they look at any year as investors what one of their favorite indicators is saying about the state of the market right now and what to make of Bitcoin as it hovers around 100000 Loren Horst Tom welcome Tom Gardner Great to be here Lauren Loren Horst Lets begin with a bigpicture playbook question For an investor who wants to have more success in the stock market whats the play here Tom Gardner Mostly the playbook is a timeless playbook and in hidden gems we have some things that are particular to our style and approach which I will share a little bit in this answer and during our conversation But theres a larger classic rule book at the Fool which is that were longterm oriented We dont really think about an individual year as being very consequential There are big impact years in the stock market There are years where the market falls 27 and years where the market rises 41 so these things happen They may be about to happen in 2025 I dont have a particular prediction about that because theyre very hard to foresee I would guess if I had to that it will be more of a middling year in the market maybe slightly below average returns maybe but Im not banking any of my approach on what will happen in the next year Some of the core questions that I would have members ask themselves is how long do you have to hold your investments How low can you go before you start feeling sick and how high are your hopes If I were to answer those questions and say I have 10plus years I start to feel a little sick when my portfolio is down 40 and I have high hopes That is a particular strategy that can be assigned to that set of answers For somebody who also says I have exactly five years then Im retiring Im going to feel really bad if my portfolios down 20 I have moderate hopes Im not looking to run away with it and just have a highvolatility market crushing portfolio that I just the wear and tear is difficult but Im willing to handle it Thats a different strategy You have exactly five years You dont want to see your portfolio fall more than 20 25 and you have moderate hopes You would be starting to look toward dividend payers Youd be looking for lower volatility companies to invest in larger caps My playbook for 2025 as it is for every year is know thyself and continue to explore your situation because it does change What you thought three years ago about your financial life is not the same as today Those Fools who have children they make their way through life There are different expenditures that you have to prepare for Then there are scenarios you werent expecting Like theres an illness in the family and thats going to take some additional money to solve We have to be prepared for the unknown The only way to do that that I know of is to continually examine your situation your temperament your time horizon what you enjoy doing in life and answer those questions and build your approach accordingly I would just say that I think weve had quite a run here and a lot of growth stocks have really moved up rapidly and so I would be tilting a little bit toward caution At least for the average member but I think its even more important than what I have to say there is getting to know yourself and your situation better and better Loren Horst That leads in quite nicely to the potential growth indicator We talk about it often but its the data point that we can revisit all the time In short it compares the ratio of cash in taxable money market accounts to the total value of US stocks The higher the PGA the more bullish investors should be What does the current PGI level tell a typical stock advisor member right now Tom Gardner Well its at about 109 and thats essentially how much money is sitting on the sidelines as you explained so 109 it means that about 11 of the total value of stocks is sitting in cash If that number goes down the available capital to invest in the market goes down to 8 That would be a big danger sign Theres not new money to come into the market to push the prices of companies higher so at 109 thats pretty much in the normal range a little bit lower than we would like If it goes up to 15 it means theres a lot of cash sitting on the sidelines When you get a spike of selling as happened in March of 2020 with the pandemic and peoples getting very fearful it jumped to about 1920 cash on the sidelines Thats a really good time to invest for long term investors It doesnt mean the market cant go down more It doesnt mean there can be even more cash on the sidelines In the financial crisis it got to 50 but thats a onceinalifetime occurrence to have that Now were at 109 I would say that there is another factor to consider because the PGI only measures cash in the US Theres a lot of money coming in from outside the US right now Just illustrative is Masayoshi Son meeting with President Trump and committing to 100 billion investment in US companies to build AI infrastructure Then President Trump said how about 200 billion laughs Masayoshi did his best to give a little bit of wiggle room but say we will try Thats representative of whats already happening here with what will be one of the most businessfriendly most deregulating administrations in American history and there are some wonderful things about that and there obviously can be some problems with that sometimes some very serious problems with that But theres no question its a massively businessfriendly environment That given the strength of the US market regulatory structure and the history of innovation in the US the most innovative companies the best tech companies in the world theyre all in the US theyre virtually all in the US and we have a funding mechanism for them Now were saying its going to be even more beneficial For people starting companies growing companies hiring making investments and thats drawing in money from around the world I think 109 may even be a little bit misleading Theres so much international foreign worldwide cash in that I actually think the market may be even more overvalued than the PGI would indicate Im particularly saying that to anyone that has a low threshold for pain in terms of stock market volatility or has a shorter time period where theyre going to need that capital three years from now or five years from now instead of 81520 years from now I think if youre getting down to that fiveyear range and you really need things to go reasonably well I think you need to be looking at the distinctions on the Motley Fool site of companies that are classified as cautious and moderate versus companies that are aggressive It doesnt mean sell those aggressive holdings necessarily although maybe its a good idea to sell a few percentage points here and there to reduce large positions in highgrowth highvalue aggressive stocks in your portfolio Again depending on your situation But what I would say is at least you could start adding new money toward again large caps dividend payers low Beta stocks Boring sleepy Its when you sit there and you say gosh Ive run all the numbers on this I think I might only get like 111 a year from this investment Thats not that exciting Once you start saying that when an 11 return 01 return is quite satisfactory Once people start saying that more and more thats another sign hubris animal spirits as everyones saying and over high expectations This could get people out over their skis Again the shorter your time horizon and the less threshold tolerance for pain you have I think the PGI and whats happening in the marketplace is saying start thinking about moderate cautious investments in the hidden gems methodology we love having a cash position on the sidelines Maybe think about a 10 cash position Consider those options Thats what the PGI is telling me and other factors today Loren Horst Well one important thing to remember is that stocks arent the only place that cash on the sideline can go and 2024 was a big year for Bitcoin The first decentralized cryptocurrency crossed the 100000 mark and it can be pretty polarizing but its worked out so far for longtime bulls like you Tom What do you make of Bitcoins latest runup Tom Gardner Well Bitcoin is above 100000 That puts its market cap at two trillion On the one hand something that is nothing is worth two trillion Thats speaking to those who really dont believe in this at all Something that is absolutely nothing is now worth 2 trillion I hope youre happy Weve seen it before Read the book famous Financial Fiascos I believe it was written by John Tran Famous Financial Fiascos You can read that book during lunch Its about a 120page book with 40 different threepage chapters on financial calamities throughout history Its a wonderful book Read it Because anti Bitcoin is saying this is the next chapter and its not three page chapter yet Were only a page and a quarter into this chapter Wait to see what happens next because this is all going to zero Ive seen this before That is one of you To dismiss that out of hand I think that is to blind yourself from history and from our human instincts our untrained minds our big hopes and our delusions Thats at least a big part of the Bitcoin story The other side of it is whats so great about gold again Why do I want to own gold Why is gold a hedge Why does gold a hedge against inflation or diminishment of fiat currency Why is gold Because 90 of the value of gold has nothing to do with its use or even jewelry Its just speculative If gold is worth lets just say 18 trillion and Bitcoins is worth two trillion and 90 of the value of gold is just speculation about it as an asset a hedge in the marketplace why exactly do we assign that value to gold If were willing to do that why wouldnt we assign it to a digital system that has proven to be secure with a worldwide brand name that has the promise of a limited a supply cap and not just why would I assign value to gold but why do you think future generations would Why do we not think that people change where they choose to assign value What would cause somebody to really say that the average 23yearold today is thinking when I get my whole portfolio bill Im definitely going to have a slice for gold but Bitcoin is a joke when they see so much of their life is digital Theyre taking online courses they have an Instagram They see people making millions of dollars taking photos on Instagram So much money is about their digital presence in this world not their physical presence Why do we think a 23yearold is going to say give me gold bars I want Kruger ants for my holiday gift Bitcoin is a joke Thats the other side of the story I dont think that theres a automatically correct answer I asked on our Twitter feed What are the percentage chances you are willing to change your opinion on Bitcoin And 52 of everyone said zero What that means to me is if you choose to talk about Bitcoin these holidays youre going to be choosing to talk about politics religion and any other third rail issue thats just divisive because there are a lot of people who made their mind up about Bitcoin I happen to be in the other 48 I have invested in Bitcoin I have made dozens of recommendations over 40 recommendations in real money portfolios with cost basis as low as 20000 My highest purchase price for Bitcoin is 72000 Its now at 104000 I would not be surprised to see it go back to 72000 Bitcoins been volatile Its fallen 70 multiple times Same thing with Netflix and same thing with other great companies throughout history see their stock price that volatile I would say I would not be at all surprised If Bitcoin goes to 72000 Im not changing my thesis or approach on it at all I think that could easily happen Conversely this administration is very favorable toward cryptocurrency and the appointments are indicating that there will be a new regulatory structure and regime to cryptocurrency Furthermore Bitcoin is rising now not because individuals are speculating at it in their digital wallets or even just buying ETFs Its institutions now that are moving into BTC Its institutional money This is worth two trillion The companies in this world that are worth two trillion they arent 94 owned by individuals Whats happening is institutions are buying in Theyre saying we need to put 1 This asset has some role to play in our portfolio Thats how I started my investments in Bitcoin with two and 3 positions 1 I think one portfolio put 5 in But it was never hey fold on every other investment and just Bitcoin maximalist across all investment opportunities Definitely not But I have always said I think its a good idea to have 13 of your portfolio Its the leading digital asset brand in the world it has proven secure I think having 13 of your portfolio Bitcoin to me it was pretty much automatic to do it I dont want to overstate that because I know many people dont and havent made that investment and are now thinking what should I do with it at 100000 But I would say what I said when it was at 20000 or at 40000 or at 60000 which is put 1 in Put 1 2 its the leading its the number one brand for digital assets in a

to stocks on our radar Our man behind the glass Rick Engdahl is going to hit you with a question Bill youre up first What are you looking at this week Bill Mann The company that Im looking at is Darden Restaurants which is the owner of Olive Garden Eddie Vs Ruths Chris Steak House the Capitol Grille and a number of others Restaurants have had a tough couple of years by virtue of the fact that their labor cost and cost of goods have gone up in fairly uncontrolled fashion A lot of people are calling for a slower growth in both But there are these things that may be coming down the pike in the form of tariffs which would impact the restaurant industry really really sharply in terms of a rise in costs These tend to be very thinmargin companies Darden among them Im interested to see what happens macroeconomically and how it impacts endless breadsticks Rick a question about Darden restaurants ticker DRI or endless breadsticks Rick Engdahl Do you have a favorite Darden restaurant Because Im looking at the web page here and none of them are jumping out to me I wouldnt choose any of them for dinner tonight Bill Mann I do actually love Ruths Chris I think its actually a good unique place to go Rick Engdahl I learned to cook over the pandemic years and sorry I just dont buy steaky restaurants anymore laughs Dylan Lewis Well be getting our recipes from Rick for the rest of 2025 Asit whats on your radar this week Asit Sharma Dylan I want to read a headline from NBC News recent headline Film fans flock to Interstellar IMAX 70 millimeter release If you saw this headline you probably saw that it was almost impossible to get tickets to this IMAX release That reminded me that my investing colleague Meilin Quinn had been talking about IMAX last year as maybe an interesting play This is a company that had a slowdown overindexed in China and is a little bit of a turnaround play although its had a good 2024 Looking for a promising slate of about 12 billion in global box office receipts that will be tied to the platform in 2025 Their system installs are up They make money installing IMAX systems and also through licensing Just a really popular slate of movies coming out This company is now cash flow positive I think its going to increase its cash flow in the coming years A little bit of a risky stock But hey this is where the movie industry is trending toward bigger and better films so I am looking forward to following IMAX some more in 2025 Dylan Lewis Rick are you a bigger fan of IMAX than the Darden Restaurant Chain portfolio Rick Engdahl I think so I either watch movies at home or may as well go to IMAX Dylan Lewis Thats the one going on your watch list this week Bill Asit thanks for bringing the radar stocks Rick thanks for

of the years hottest artificial intelligence AI plays on the market The boom in AI applications in 2024 brought with it the concomitant need to invest in data centers to support that growth Ill get to Vistras role in a moment first a few words on how nuclear power became popular in 2024 There is a critical need to secure a longterm reliable power source for data centers and nuclear power is increasingly seen as the answer Nuclear power is seen as a carbonfree way to ensure reliable power and it has become even more popular considering renewable energys difficulties in recent years including surging costs logistics issues and supply chain constraints Indeed its no coincidence that the most significant three cloud service providers signed deals with nuclear power producers in 2024 Microsoft inked a longterm power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy to restart part of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant Alphabets Google signed a deal to buy nuclear energy from small modular reactors SMR developed by Kairos Power Meanwhile Amazons Amazon Web Services paid 650 million to buy a data center campus from Talen Energy and signed a longterm deal to buy power from Talens nearby nuclear plant Amazon also signed deals to support the development of SMRs While the AmazonTalen deal received a blow when the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected a proposal

prize for being the largest company in the world by market cap but its a position that many companies envy Right now Apple NASDAQ AAPL is the largest although Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA is right on its tail and may move in and out of first place depending on the markets daily swings Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT is in third place but it would need to rise about 16 to take the lead from Apple As a result the race for the title of worlds most valuable company by the end of 2025 is likely between just Nvidia and Apple barring major news from Microsoft that vaults it into the lead Apple has held the title pretty much since 2011 but can Nvidia take it over by the end of the year Apple is by far the leading consumer tech brand and a large percentage of consumers already have an iPhone Most iPhone users are also devoted to the Apple ecosystem and may own its AirPods MacBooks iPads and smartwatches This dominance has made the company the worlds largest for a long time Nvidia has received much more attention during the past two years with its primary product the graphics processing unit GPU which it invented in 1995 The original purpose of a GPU was for processing video gaming graphics but other uses were soon discovered Because the GPU can process multiple calculations in parallel it became the choice for any task that required vast amounts of computing power This expanded its functions into engineering simulations drug discovery cryptocurrency mining and artificial intelligence AI model training AI training has been a huge theme during the past few years and with Nvidias GPUs and software being the best available for the job the company quickly established dominance in the market GPU demand has rapidly risen since 2023 as shown by the chipmakers revenue growth In just two years the company has gone from about 30 billion in annual revenue to more than 100 billion and Wall Street analysts still forecast enormous growth during the next two years With more than 50 growth expected in fiscal 2026 ending January 2026 Nvidia still seems to have plenty of potential But what about Apple Apples growth has been nonexistent during the past few years and its revenue has been little changed during the same frame as covered in the Nvidia charts above Its overall revenue figure is much higher than Nvidias but it has shown no growth in earnings per share or revenue in the period However during the past three years Apples stock has risen 42 How is this possible Investors have been willing to pay more for Apples earnings which has caused the valuation to skyrocket The same trend also happened with Nvidia but it had considerable underlying growth as well After the runup during the past few years Apples stock is within shouting distance of the chipmakers pricetoearnings PE valuation Nvidia still holds about a 46 premium to Apples stock from a PE perspective However Nvidia earnings per share EPS are forecast on average to rise by 50 while Apples EPS is projected to grow by 22 The question for investors is For two companies producing about the same earnings should the one growing faster be valued higher than the one growing slower The answer seems obvious and as a result I think fastergrowing Nvidia will be the worlds most valuable company by the end of the year as long as analyst projections are close to correct Before you buy stock in Nvidia

keeping the years and decades ahead in mind Businesses that are successful have likely spent years innovating and evolving That describes Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA well as it originally developed leading central processing unit CPU computer chips used in gaming and eventually cryptocurrency mining applications Now its the leading supplier for artificial intelligence AI applications Nvidia has been all the rage among market watches recently but the company has been around for over 30 years Its been publicly traded since early 1999 CEO Jensen Huang was among the founders who initially aimed to develop graphics chips for personal computers Its CUDA compute unified device architecture software platform was launched almost 20 years ago and it is now an important part of the investment case The focus in its early years was on performance improvements in 3D graphics used in the gaming industry But the stock performance lagged until the early 2020s when revenue began to grow from the Nvidia RTX platform that uses AI to create realistic graphics and visual effects for gaming 3D design and other uses Huangs keynote speech at the recent CES conference was used to introduce the RTX 50series chips that use Nvidias Blackwell graphics processing unit GPU architecture in the companys AI accelerators That circle of innovation is what investors need to keep in mind to see what Nvidia can do in the coming decade And Huang gave everyone a brief introduction to whats coming in that CES keynote address Nvidias recent stock returns have been nothing short of phenomenal As AI drives the need for more computing power quarterly revenue increased by over 1000 since 2020 Much of that came in the last two years as large tech companies spent heavily to build out data centers needed for AI applications Those companies are still investing to boost compute power Microsoft President Brad Smith recently said his company expects to invest 80 billion in its fiscal 2025 for AIenabled data centers used to train models Smith commented None of this progress would be possible without new partnerships founded on largescale infrastructure investments that serve as the essential foundation of AI innovation and use Amazon also recently announced it has plans to spend about 11 billion to expand its presence in Georgia to support Amazon Web Services AWS cloud computing and AI technologies Nvidia is arguably the biggest beneficiary of this spending and investors have poured into the stock driving shares over 2000 higher since 2020 Nvidias data center segment dominated its revenue path recently but gaming revenue is still growing and represented a meaningful 94 of total revenue in the recent quarter Huang sees another avenue for growth coming Nvidias secondfastestgrowing segment in the most recent quarter was automotive and robotics with a 72 yearoveryear revenue increase In his CES conference speech Huang spoke a lot about robots and selfdriving cars two realworld applications made possible by AI Huang sees the robotics era coming soon and grouped both humanoid robots and selfdriving cars in that category He said it could be the largest technology industry the world has ever seen Nvidias robot operating system ROS Isaac utilizes its CUDAaccelerated software packages and AI models to develop advanced AI robotics applications He also announced Nvidias nextgeneration processor for autonomous cars called Thor Thor processes the massive amount of sensor information from cameras radar and lidar light detection and ranging being used on vehicles Using Nvidias latest CPU and GPU advances including Blackwell architecture Huang said Thor has 20 times the processing capability of the previous generation chip which is the standard today The Thor processor is also used for humanoid robots Huang described it as a universal robotics computer One can see how each of Nvidias segments and innovations is interconnected And thats precisely why Nvidia stock could still be the best investment of the next decade Huang said he expects surprisingly rapid breakthroughs in general robotics in the next several years And Nvidia supplies all the enabling technologies As if it needs another growth segment Huang also introduced an AI desktop computer at CES that incorporates Blackwell He said Placing an AI supercomputer on the desks of every data scientist AI researcher and student empowers them to engage and shape the age of AI That desktop supercomputer will be available in May for a price of 3000 Its another example of the companys innovative approach that pushes the boundaries of technology Nvidia has many ongoing projects and somehow seems to connect them all It should be a core holding in any growth stock portfolio for the next decade Ever feel like you missed

producing the worlds most valuable companies United States Steel became the first 1 billion company in 1901 General Motors rode the automotive boom to become the firstever 10 billion company in 1955 General Electric which manufactures refrigerators and airplane engines among many other things became the worlds first 100 billion company in 1995 Apple hit the most significant milestone to date when its valuation crossed 1 trillion for the first time in 2018 thanks to the success of devices like the iPhone Apple is still the worlds largest company with a market capitalization of 37 trillion But since 2018 seven other American technology companies have joined it in the trilliondollar club Microsoft Nvidia Amazon Alphabet Meta Platforms Tesla and Broadcom I think one more company is set to earn its membership in this club within the next four years Some of the biggest artificial intelligence AI developers in the world are lining up to rent Oracles NYSE ORCL industryleading data center infrastructure and this part of its business could grow more than tenfold according to managements guidance Oracles market cap is 463 billion as of this writing so if it does join the 1 trillion club in four years as I predict investors who buy its stock today could earn a very nice return of 116 Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts data center operators like Oracle Microsoft and Amazon will spend 1 trillion over the next four years on upgrading their infrastructure to meet demand from AI developers That involves filling them with thousands of graphics processors GPUs which are specialized chips designed to ingest and process mountains of data for AI workloads Nvidia supplies the most powerful GPUs in the industry And Oracles Cloud Infrastructure OCI supercluster technology enables developers to scale up to 65000 of Nvidias H200 GPUs which is the highest number in the industry To put it simply access to more chips can enable developers to build and deploy larger models which translates into smarter AI software OCIs random direct memory access RDMA technology also allows data to flow from one point to another much faster than traditional Ethernet networks And since most developers rent computing capacity by the minute faster processing can equal major cost savings During its recent fiscal 2025 second quarter ended Oct 31 Oracle said GPU use climbed by 336 compared to the same period in fiscal 2024 which speaks to how quickly demand is ramping up So far OCIs infrastructure has attracted top AI startups like Cohere OpenAI and Elon Musks xAI Oracle currently operates 98 data center regions and plans to grow that footprint by more than tenfold to somewhere between 1000 and 2000 locations over time The companys OCI will soon offer new clusters featuring over 131000 of Nvidias latest Blackwell GPUs which will pave the way for the most advanced AI applications yet and potentially drive a new wave of demand Oracle generated 141 billion in total revenue during the second quarter but the OCI segment was responsible for just 24 billion of that total so it isnt a massive contributor yet Its still smaller than Oracles softwareasaservice SaaS business which generated 35 billion in revenue during the quarter It offers readymade cloud applications to help businesses across dozens of industries manage everything from their inventory to their payroll However OCI is consistently the star performer when it comes to growth While SaaS revenue grew by 10 year over year during the second quarter OCI revenue soared by 52 It was the fastest growth in a year and it marked the second consecutive quarter of acceleration OCI revenue would have grown even faster if Oracle had more data center capacity available but its still struggling to meet demand even though its building infrastructure as quickly as possible That demand can be seen in Oracles remaining performance obligations RPOs which soared by 50 during the second quarter to 97 billion RPOs typically convert into revenue at a future date once the company can deliver the agreedupon services ie OCI revenue could surge once it can bring more data centers on line based on the deals it has already locked in Oracle CEO Safra Catz predicts RPOs will grow even higher from here because of the sheer volume of deals the company is signing including a major one with Meta Platforms recently Meta developed the worlds most popular opensource large language models LLMs called Llama which have been downloaded over 600 million times and the company will shift some of its training workloads over to Oracles infrastructure Oracle stock trades at a pricetoearnings ratio PE of 405 which is a slight premium to the average PE of Microsoft Amazon and Alphabet 367 They are three of the biggest operators of AI data center infrastructure besides Oracle But Oracle stock looks much more attractive when we measure its value based on its potential earnings For example Wall Streets consensus estimate provided by Yahoo suggests the companys earnings per share EPS will grow by 144 to 705 during its fiscal year 2026 which starts in June of this calendar year That places its stock at a forward PE of just 235 Mathematically speaking Oracle stock would have to soar by 723 over the next 18 months just to maintain its current PE of 405 which would value the company at almost 800 billion If it grows its EPS by 144 again in fiscal 2027 and fiscal 2028 while maintaining the same PE it will be a 104 trillion company Even if its PE settles at 367 its valuation would still be around 950 billion But Oracles earnings actually grew by 22 in the first half of fiscal 2025 and I think that pace is likely to persist and maybe even accelerate suggesting Wall Street might be too conservative Remember The company plans to grow its data center footprint more than tenfold And its infrastructure is unique because its fully automated meaning it should become significantly more profitable at scale In fact during the last couple of quarterly conference calls with investors Catz talked about how the gross profit margin of the infrastructure business is climbing as more data centers come on line If Oracle grows its earnings by 22 annually instead of 14 through fiscal 2028 it will be a shooin to join the 1 trillion club even if its PE drops to around 34 Before you buy stock in Oracle consider this The

the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist Tesla NASDAQ TSLA is probably the most interesting name on Ives list For much of 2024 shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market But beginning in early November shares started going parabolic All told Tesla stock gained 62 in 2024 nearly triple that of the SP 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite The catalyst that fueled Teslas rebound The outcome of the US presidential election During the final months of Donald Trumps campaign Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate Following Trumps victory in early November Ives made it clear that he sees Musks relationship with the presidentelect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla Specifically Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fasttrack Teslas autonomous driving and robotaxi plans While I think Ives outlook makes sense its important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Teslas share price following the election results Is it really surprising to see Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA listed as a top idea for 2025 Last year Nvidia was the topperforming Magnificent Seven stock with shares climbing 171 and the companys valuation gaining more than 2 trillion Despite this unprecedented move Ives is calling for significantly

integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon Alphabet and Oracle Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied

upgrade their devices en masse Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense I question how it will play out in reality Apple was late to the AI game and Im not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones Remember Apples consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury If your old iPhone is still manageable Apples AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a highercost device While Id love to be proven wrong on this one Apple is the one stock on this list that Im hesitant about right now To me Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks Ive explored Similar to Microsoft Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AIpowered services from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools advertising streaming consumer hardware and more Alphabet is an extremely diversified business and the companys revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction Yet despite the companys impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities Alphabet only trades at a forward pricetoearnings PE multiple of 219 thats lower than the average forward PE of the SP 500 I think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok While I understand these concerns in theory I think Alphabets financial results depicted above speak for themselves To me an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for

tag claim Musk has indicated that the Cybercab will have a production cost of approximately 30000 Operating within the robotaxi fleet is projected to cost around 020 per mile With a production cost of 30000 the retail price of the Cybercab is likely to exceed this figure For instance if the Cybercab is priced at 30000 per unit that translates to 15000 per seat In contrast the average price per

was one sector that just didnt work for investors in 2024 it was budget retailersconvenience pharmacies Walgreens Boots Alliance Dollar Tree Dollar General and CVS Health were among the worstperforming stocks in 2024 Each of them declined by at least 40 for the year with Walgreens losing more than 60 of its value The effects of inflation took a toll on all of these companies as consumers cut back on purchases As for the pharmacy retailers falling reimbursement rates for drugs increased theft and rising competition sent shares tumbling Running a close second to the budget

future revenue could come under pressure To sum up discount retailers convenience pharmacies and certain drugmakers were the big losers in 2024 As has been the case for many years I currently prefer growth stocks to value stocks In particular the tech sector remains a favorite of mine However surveying the tech landscape at the start of 2025 three stocks stand out as companies that I want to buy and hold forever Nvidia Amazon Tesla NASDAQ TSLA Nvidia makes the cut because it remains the primary beneficiary of the AI boom While Nvidias competitive advantage will eventually fade there are no signs of it happening anytime soon The company still designs the best AI chips and demand for its products remains redhot In turn the company is growing revenue and profits at a breakneck pace In short it remains all systems go for Nvidia as 2025 gets under way As for Amazon Im a longtime believer and shareholder in the company As Ive noted before Amazon is best viewed as a conglomerate rather than simply an ecommerce company Amazon Web Services AWS now generates over 100 billion in revenue per year making it a giant in its own right if it were ever spun off into its own company As for ecommerce Amazon is growing its profitability through innovations like robotics which drive down costs and shorten delivery times to consumers Finally theres Tesla Similar to Amazon I believe investors need to adjust how they think of Tesla True automotive sales still make up a huge share of the companys revenue but increasingly Tesla is becoming a robotics company As its autonomous driving software FSD improves Teslas true value could be unlocked as the company expands into ridesharing autonomous deliveries and futuristic applications we havent even considered Thats to say nothing of the companys Optimus robot which could provide another revenue stream To sum up Teslas future still looks bright as we step into 2025 making it one of my top choices as a stock to buy and

have advanced 34 during the past year but that upside has been driven almost entirely by valuation multiple expansion rather than earnings growth Consequently some Wall Street analysts have turned bearish on the stock in the last couple of weeks Tim Long at Barclays recently initiated coverage on Apple with a sell rating and a target of 184 per share That forecast implies 24 downside from the current share price of 243 Tesla NASDAQ TSLA shares have advanced 66 over the past year but not because of business fundaments Instead the upside has been driven by expectations the company will benefit from the ties between CEO Elon Musk and Presidentelect Donald Trump Not surprisingly some analysts are bearish Ryan Brinkman at JP Morgan recently reiterated his sell rating on Tesla and kept his target price at 135 per share That forecast implies 66 downside from its current share price of 395 Heres what investors should know about Apple and Tesla The investment thesis for Apple is twofold First the company is the market leader in smartphones in terms of revenue and has a strong presence in several other consumer electronics markets The loyalty its premium devices inspire should bring more consumers to its ecosystem while also supporting higher prices Indeed the average iPhone sold for 3 times more than the average Samsung smartphone in the Septemberending quarter Second Apple has used its brand authority to build a thriving services business that enables it to more deeply monetize its installed base The company has a strong presence in several relevant markets including mobile applications mobile payments and digital advertising Services earn higher margins than products and the services segment is growing more quickly which means Apple should become more profitable over time However investors got too excited about the recent introduction of Apple Intelligence a suite of artificial intelligence AI features that many analysts said would spur a massive iPhone upgrade cycle That thesis has so far proven false Craig Moffett at MoffettNathanson in a recent note to clients wrote Not only have we not seen any sign of an upgrade cycle but we have seen growing evidence that consumers are unmoved by AI functionality Wall Street expects Apples adjusted earnings to increase 9 in fiscal 2025 which ends in September That consensus makes the current valuation of 359 times adjusted earnings look extremely and unsustainably expensive Personally I expect shares to trend lower unless Apple shocks analysts with earnings well above consensus Shareholders with big positions should consider trimming The investment thesis for Tesla is twofold First while the company narrowly held its lead in electric car sales through November it lost 3 percentage points of market share last year But that trend could reverse following the launch of a sub30000 vehicle reportedly called the Model Q in the first half of 2025 At the same time Teslas margins could expand as it continues to focus on manufacturing efficiency Second Tesla has a more substantial opportunity in full selfdriving FSD software and robotaxi services The company reported a 1000fold improvement in FSD last year in terms of miles per critical intervention So Tesla plans to release an unsupervised version of FSD and open a ridehailing service in Texas and California this year Musk recently reminded analysts that the future is autonomous Wall Street thinks Teslas adjusted earnings will grow at 27 annually through 2025 That makes the current valuation of 164 times adjusted earnings look absurdly expensive However Dan Ives at Wedbush sees the situation differently On Nov 29 he told CNBC Today I view Tesla as the most undervalued AI name in the market The stock is up 14 since then but Ives bullcase target at 650 per share still implies 65 upside from the current share price of 395 Ultimately Tesla is a risky investment because much of its valuation is based on products that have yet to become material revenue streams meaning FSD software and robotaxis Investors who lack confidence in the autonomous driving narrative should avoid the stock And shareholders in that category should exit their positions In the absence of autonomous driving technology Tesla shares are wildly overvalued Alternatively investors who are confident that Tesla can disrupt transportation and mobility should consider buying a small position And current shareholders in that category should continue holding the stock provided they are comfortable with volatility Tesla is richly valued and shares may decline sharply on any bad news But if it becomes the autonomous driving powerhouse it aims to be Tesla should be worth far more in the future Before you buy

look at where Tesla Inc NASDAQTSLA stands against other stocks ahead of major AI event that Jim Cramer discussed In his appearance on Squawk on the Street the day CES took place in Las Vegas Jim Cramer commented on the stock market division that persisted throughout 2024 and is present in 2025 as well The division has seen technology stocks perform well while other ratesensitive sectors such as industrial and materials stocks have languished Cramer commented on the reasons behind it I think thats because people perceive that the rest of the market is hostage to rates And that tech is not hostage to anything So Im aware of that and Im just concerned that you have this speech tonight ninethirty Jensen Huang everyones were really kind of whatever he says is going to move things In fact this division is so prevalent that some of the biggest asset managers in the world have also been unable to remain immune to it Mentioning a piece in the Financial Times Cramer shared that it commented about private equity and private equity trying to get into the 401k business He added and mentioned Marc Rowan CEO of Apollo says I jokingly say sometimes we levered the entire retirement inaudible to NVIDIAs performance So inaudible weve got the NVIDIAs of the world which everybody likes and on the other hand theres these stocks are they really are hostage to rates and no one wants them However even though technology stocks have stood the test of high interest rates they might falter in some circumstances One of these can be bond yields and if the thirtyyear yield spikes to 5 then Cramer believes that will start interfering with this tech rally that seems to be motivated by a lot of analysts coming out and saying this is the time theres now reacceleration in tech spend The CNBC host also speculated on what Jensen Huang might end up talking about at CES later in the day He stated I think that one of the things that Jensen is going to talk about today are all the new use cases This is tonights CES talk It wouldnt surprise me if we start hearing about robots It wouldnt surprise me if we didnt hear a lot about Tesla Tesla and selfdriving cars Tesla and the neural network that is based on NVIDIA Along with industrial and material stocks another sector thats caught Cramers attention is banks Mentioning a recent investment bank note about the sector he believes that one of the groups that I think we have to focus on theres a really interesting uh Barclays piece on the banks Darkest before dawn Raising the group for the first time since 2019 emphasis here on Citi Cramer also outlined that while technology valuations might appear to be overstretched this isnt the case with banks He shared This is a group that when you look at it theyre selling at 11 times 2026 numbers So the idea that you have this valuation problem in the market well look at these stocks Theres no valuation problem with materials Or with banks He added The valuation problem is with the stuff that keeps getting upgraded which is enterprise software So theres a little duplicitous nature among the top people who work at these firms because they should be saying look there are two markets Theres the inexpensive market and were warming up to it and the expensive market and we dont know what to do To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBCs Squawk on the Street aired on Monday For these stocks we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in The reason is simple our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds Our quarterly newsletters strategy selects 14 smallcap and

is the worlds largest pureplay electric vehicle manufacturer However unlike other EV companies like Lucid Motors and Rivian Tesla Inc NASDAQTSLAs narrative is broader and depends on other factors such as robotaxis assisteddriving technologies and its CEOs relationship with the incoming Trump Administration The EV slowdown drove Tesla Inc NASDAQTSLAs in 2024 up until the November election Ahead of the election the stock was up by just 1 but since then the shares have gained 57 Cramer also commented on the nonEV factors driving Tesla Inc NASDAQTSLAs stock as he shared Now one of the things is this existential crisis of robotaxis Its so convoluted I have no idea whats going to happen but the new Street piece about Tesla is saying listen dont regard Tesla as an auto company its about robotaxis its about handsfree driving You know the one thing that we have to recognize is that there are a lot of people behind the scenes that are saying that Musk ultimately will prevail with the president and say wow the president presidentelect theres so much data thats actually been computed that how can we not let Tesla jump ahead of Waymo And we have the federal interstate highway system lets just let it selfdrive Overall TSLA ranks 5th on our list of stocks ahead of major AI event that Jim Cramer discussed While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment our conviction

with the circuit board issue and will replace the computer at no cost to the owner The company began an investigation after noting an increase in car computer replacements due to short circuit problems in November The investigation revealed that certain software and hardware configurations especially in colder temperatures could lead to an increase in reverse current raising the risk of a short in power components To prevent the issue Tesla stated that Model 3 Model S and Model X vehicles in production have been equipped with a different car computer variant since 16 December 2024 The

crossover accounts for roughly 12 million units or two out of every three Teslas sold Tesla finally revealed one of its bestkept secrets pulling back the cloth on a refreshed newer version of its bestselling Model Y Its hard to overstate just how high the stakes are for CEO Elon Musk whose company just suffered a historic drop in annual sales The midsize crossover is the brands bestseller by far Last year it accounted for roughly 12 million units delivered or two out of every three cars Tesla sold Yet the vehicle faces increasing competition as it enters its sixth year in the US market Due out first in China come March the newer vehicle codenamed Juniper is now available to order on Teslas local website It touches up some exterior styling cues including headlights that borrow heavily from the Cybercab robotaxi concept while offering more extensive changes in the passenger cabin The longrange version better suited for American roads retails at 303500 yuan 41400 and manages 719 kilometers 447 miles on one charge under Chinas far more forgiving test cycle The latter represents a slight improvement of 45 over the current version The US launch date price in dollars and EPAestimated range have not been released but they are likely to be substantially different if for no other reason than Tesla sources the bulk of its madeinChina vehicles locally Tesla did not respond to a Fortune request for comment A lot is riding on Junipers success No other major global carmaker is so heavily dependent on just one product to drive overall revenue and profits let alone a company worth more than the rest of its collective peers combined Even a moderate drop in demand would have a material effect on Teslas business especially as the EV makers launch date for its lowcost entry model is not exactly clear Investors hope Juniper will reignite demand enough to keep Tesla factories humming with a minimum of margineroding rebates and incentives A key reason both production and deliveries sank last year was the belief that Model Y owners were waiting for Junipers arrival before submitting their next purchasing order To achieve the envisaged accelerated sales growth in 2025 the new entry model is essential in our view UBS said referring to Musks promise to grow volumes by 20 to 30 this year Notably the look differs from that of its sibling the Model 3 Highland whose front grille and headlights are more minor refinements from the original design Junipers front features the same single light bar stretching across the hood that first featured on the Cybertruck pickup before it was grafted onto the body of a conventional passenger car with the Cybercab The refreshed Model Ys rear also includes a light bar borrowed from the robotaxi but is much fatter in appearance Oddly enough one of the most controversial aspects is the apparent continued presence of an indicator stalk This ubiquitous instrument was replaced when the Ys sibling the Model 3 Highland underwent its design upgrade In keeping with Musks philosophy that the best part is no part drivers were instead told they would now have to press a button when signaling a turn The decision proved highly divisive among the CEOs otherwise fiercely loyal customer base But indicators are safetyrelevant and stalks are intuitive By comparison signaling buttons can more easily be mixed up while driving If Juniper retains a stalk it would be a rare example of Tesla completely reversing course Whether the changes are sufficient enough to deliver the boost Tesla needs remains unclear But even as it props up demand from returning customers it may fail to poach new ones from rival brands For competitors in the segment we would not see the Model Y facelift as a game changer UBS concluded This

has recently been on Zackscoms list of the most searched stocks Therefore you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stocks performance in the near future Over the past month shares of this electric car maker have returned 55 compared to the Zacks SP 500 composites 22 change During this period the Zacks Automotive Domestic industry which Tesla falls in has lost 4 The key question now is What could be the stocks future direction While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a companys business prospects usually make its stock trending and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buyandhold decisionmaking Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a companys earnings projection This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings Our analysis is essentially based on how sellside analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well And when a stocks fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and shortterm stock price movements Tesla is expected to post earnings of 076 per share for the current quarter representing a yearoveryear change of 7 Over the last 30 days the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed 05 The consensus earnings estimate of 246 for the current fiscal year indicates a yearoveryear change of 212 This estimate has changed 06 over the last 30 days For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of 327 indicates a change of 33 from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago Over the past month the estimate has changed 06 Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stocks price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates Tesla is rated Zacks Rank 3 Hold The chart below shows the evolution of the companys forward 12month consensus EPS estimate Even though a companys earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues Its almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods Therefore knowing a companys potential revenue growth is crucial In the case of Tesla the consensus sales estimate of 2781 billion for the current quarter points to a yearoveryear change of 105 The 9989 billion and 11725 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of 32 and 174 respectively Tesla reported revenues of 2518 billion in the last reported quarter representing a yearoveryear change of 79 EPS of 072 for the same period compares with 066 a year ago Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2555 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of 145 The EPS surprise was 2414 Over the last four quarters the company surpassed EPS estimates just once The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period Without considering a stocks valuation no investment decision can be efficient In predicting a stocks future price performance its crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the companys growth prospects Comparing the current value of a companys valuation multiples such as its pricetoearnings PE pricetosales PS and pricetocash flow PCF to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F A is better than B B is better than C and so on making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued Tesla is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade The facts discussed here and much other

worked out incredibly well for shareholders it soared 1170 during the past five years as of Jan 8 But with its current market cap exceeding 12 trillion is Tesla a company you should be buying right now Teslas rapid ascent in the past decade is mesmerizing as the business disrupted the auto industry with its popular EV models However the market has shifted from a robust backdrop to now being much more challenging Tesla is experiencing this firsthand Last year the company delivered 1 fewer EVs than in 2023 On a trailing12month basis this important metric has actually plateaued during the past five quarters Demand in the EV market is still strong to be sure But its definitely rising at a slower pace than in past years Inflationary pressures and higher interest rates might deserve some blame Its worth pointing out that incumbent carmakers are encroaching on Teslas turf Ford reported a 35 increase in EV units sold in 2024 And General Motors reported EV sales surged 125 last year This highlights just how competitive the industry is becoming There are the legacy carmakers all getting in on the action There are also strictly EVfocused companies giving Tesla a run for its money most notably in China where EVs represent about half of overall auto sales Thats a much higher proportion than here in the US Stiffer competition also is hurting Teslas financials particularly its ability to increase profit When the EV market was less crowded Tesla was able to consistently flex its pricing power In Warren Buffetts mind this key trait is indicative of a highquality enterprise However Tesla has been cutting prices in recent years in an effort to maintain market share This could be a sign that the businesss competitive standing is under pressure Tesla generated 91 of its revenue in Q4 from the sale of EVs and related services Consequently its probably the right move to still view it as a car company one thats facing headwinds at the moment To buy such a business investors are being asked to pay a pricetoearnings PE ratio of 109 Thats an insanely high valuation for an auto manufacturer For comparisons sake the techheavy Nasdaq100 Index trades at an an average PE multiple of 32 And the shares of Nvidia the hottest company on the face of the planet can be purchased for a PE ratio of 55 Tesla is truly trading with some lofty expectations Thats because investors view the stock as a bet on what founder and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk could do Finally introducing unsupervised selfdriving capabilities could allow Tesla to realize its ultimate goal of launching a global robotaxi service There is also hope that the business can broadly commercialize its humanoid robot The success and wide adoption of autonomous tech and robotics isnt certain though There are regulatory and technical hurdles that must be cleared Whats more humans have to be comfortable with all of this particularly around the idea of giving up complete control of a car to a machine The

WASHINGTON Reuters Tesla said on Friday it is recalling about 239000 vehicles in the United States because rearview cameras may fail to work The development comes days after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened a probe into 26 million Tesla vehicles in the US over reports of crashes involving a feature that allows users to move their cars remotely Tesla said a reverse current may occur while powering up the vehicle which could cause a short circuit on the cars computer board and result in the rearview camera becoming inoperative the automaker said The automaker said the issue was the result of a sequence of specific software and hardware configurations coupled with colder temperatures Tesla said it has already pushed a software update to vehicles that changes the vehicle power up sequence to prevent the shorting failure Tesla will identify any vehicles with a circuit board issue and replace the cars computer if necessary The automaker launched an investigation after seeing an increase in car computer replacements relating to short circuit issues in November Tesla said it has 887 warranty claims and 68 field reports related to the recall but said it is not aware of any collisions injuries or fatalities related to the condition Tesla said Model 3 Model S and Model X vehicles in production also received a different car computer variant

US economy has a remarkable track record of producing the worlds most valuable companies United States Steel became the first 1 billion company in 1901 General Motors rode the automotive boom to become the firstever 10 billion company in 1955 General Electric which manufactures refrigerators and airplane engines among many other things became the worlds first 100 billion company in 1995 Apple hit the most significant milestone to date when its valuation crossed 1 trillion for the first time in 2018 thanks to the success of devices like the iPhone Apple is still the worlds largest company with a market capitalization of 37 trillion But since 2018 seven other American technology companies have joined it in the trilliondollar club Microsoft Nvidia Amazon Alphabet Meta Platforms Tesla and Broadcom I think one more company is set to earn its membership in this club within the next four years Some of the biggest artificial intelligence AI developers in the world are lining up to rent Oracles NYSE ORCL industryleading data center infrastructure and this part of its business could grow more than tenfold according to managements guidance Oracles market cap is 463 billion as of this writing so if it does join the 1 trillion club in four years as I predict investors who buy its stock today could earn a very nice return of 116 Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts data center operators like Oracle Microsoft and Amazon will spend 1 trillion over the next four years on upgrading their infrastructure to meet demand from AI developers That involves filling them with thousands of graphics processors GPUs which are specialized chips designed to ingest and process mountains of data for AI workloads Nvidia supplies the most powerful GPUs in the industry And Oracles Cloud Infrastructure OCI supercluster technology enables developers to scale up to 65000 of Nvidias H200 GPUs which is the highest number in the industry To put it simply access to more chips can enable developers to build and deploy larger models which translates into smarter AI software OCIs random direct memory access RDMA technology also allows data to flow from one point to another much faster than traditional Ethernet networks And since most developers rent computing capacity by the minute faster processing can equal major cost savings During its recent fiscal 2025 second quarter ended Oct 31 Oracle said GPU use climbed by 336 compared to the same period in fiscal 2024 which speaks to how quickly demand is ramping up So far OCIs infrastructure has attracted top AI startups like Cohere OpenAI and Elon Musks xAI Oracle currently operates 98 data center regions and plans to grow that footprint by more than tenfold to somewhere between 1000 and 2000 locations over time The companys OCI will soon offer new clusters featuring over 131000 of Nvidias latest Blackwell GPUs which will pave the way for the most advanced AI applications yet and potentially drive a new wave of demand Oracle generated 141 billion in total revenue during the second quarter but the OCI segment was responsible for just 24 billion of that total so it isnt a massive contributor yet Its still smaller than Oracles softwareasaservice SaaS business which generated 35 billion in revenue during the quarter It offers readymade cloud applications to help businesses across dozens of industries manage everything from their inventory to their payroll However OCI is consistently the star performer when it comes to growth While SaaS revenue grew by 10 year over year during the second quarter OCI revenue soared by 52 It was the fastest growth in a year and it marked the second consecutive quarter of acceleration OCI revenue would have grown even faster if Oracle had more data center capacity available but its still struggling to meet demand even though its building infrastructure as quickly as possible That demand can be seen in Oracles remaining performance obligations RPOs which soared by 50 during the second quarter to 97 billion RPOs typically convert into revenue at a future date once the company can deliver the agreedupon services ie OCI revenue could surge once it can bring more data centers on line based on the deals it has already locked in Oracle CEO Safra Catz predicts RPOs will grow even higher from here because of the sheer volume of deals the company is signing including a major one with Meta Platforms recently Meta developed the worlds most popular opensource large language models LLMs called Llama which have been downloaded over 600 million times and the company will shift some of its training workloads over to Oracles infrastructure Oracle stock trades at a pricetoearnings ratio PE of 405 which is a slight premium to the average PE of Microsoft Amazon and Alphabet 367 They are three of the biggest operators of AI data center infrastructure besides Oracle But Oracle stock looks much more attractive when we measure its value based on its potential earnings For example Wall Streets consensus estimate provided by Yahoo suggests the companys earnings per share EPS will grow by 144 to 705 during its fiscal year 2026 which starts in June of this calendar year That places its stock at a forward PE of just 235 Mathematically speaking Oracle stock would have to soar by 723 over the next 18 months just to maintain its current PE of 405 which would value the company at almost 800 billion If it grows its EPS by 144 again in fiscal 2027 and fiscal 2028 while maintaining the same PE it will be a 104 trillion company Even if its PE settles at 367 its valuation would still be around 950 billion But Oracles earnings actually grew by 22 in the first half of fiscal 2025 and I think that pace is likely to persist and maybe even accelerate suggesting Wall Street might be too conservative Remember The company plans to grow its data center footprint more than tenfold And its infrastructure is unique because its fully automated meaning it should become significantly more profitable at scale In fact during the last couple of quarterly conference calls with investors Catz talked about how the gross profit margin of the infrastructure business is climbing as more data centers come on line If Oracle grows its earnings by 22 annually instead of 14 through fiscal 2028 it will be a shooin to join the 1 trillion club even if its PE drops to around 34 Before you buy stock in Oracle consider this The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now

rose 233 in 2024 marking the first time the index posted backtoback years of 20 gains or higher since the 1990s There are 11 stock market sectors but only three beat the SP 500 last year communications financials and consumer discretionary Even the technology sector underperformed the SP 500 last year In fact only 148 SP 500 components beat the index last year meaning over 70 of components underperformed the index Heres why these three standout sectors did well last year how they can carry the momentum forward this year and lowcost exchangetraded funds ETFs you can use to invest in each sector Communications was the bestperforming sector last year producing a 348 total return capital gains plus dividends The sector was led by its three highestweighted components Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Meta Platforms NASDAQ META and Netflix NASDAQ NFLX which rose 355 654 and 831 respectively in 2024 Besides social media and streaming companies the sector has traditional media giants like Comcast and Walt Disney telecom companies and more Despite running up in 2023 and 2024 the sector remains a good value going into 2025 Legacy media companies and telecom titans tend to pay dividends and feature inexpensive valuations Even Alphabet and Meta have reasonable valuations because they generate tons of free cash flow and solid earnings growth The sector depends heavily on advertising and consumer spending So a downturn in those categories could result in slowing growth and even a sectorwide selloff But the longterm outlook for the sector is encouraging especially given Metas success with monetizing Instagram and Netflixs expanding margins and pricing power Vanguard offers lowcost sectorbased ETFs with 01 expense ratios The Vanguard Communications ETF NYSEMKT VOX mirrors the sectors performance making it a simple yet effective tool for investing in stocks like Alphabet and Meta The financial sector was a standout winner in 2024 The sector includes Berkshire Hathaway big banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley regional banks payment processors like Visa Mastercard and American Express insurance companies and more The sector has done well amid relatively higher interest rates Banks can see expanded net interest margins during periods of higher rates because the difference between the rates they collect on lending like mortgages and car loans and what they pay on deposits and savings accounts widens But higher interest rates can also slow economic growth Last year stood out because economic growth was solid despite higher rates Integrated banks and investment banks thrived with many of those companies seeing record profits and stock prices Payment processors like Visa had slowing growth but were remarkably resilient thanks to network effects that led to moderate earnings growth despite pressured consumer spending The financials sector has run up a considerable amount so it isnt as compelling a value as it used to be But relative to the SP 500 it is still a decent value The Vanguard Financials ETF NYSEMKT VFH features a 171 pricetoearnings ratio PE and a 16 dividend yield compared to a 271 PE and a 12 yield for the Vanguard SP 500 ETF NYSEMKT VOO Economic slowdowns can affect the sector making it cyclical So investors should be aware of the potential volatility before diving headfirst into the Vanguard Financials ETF The consumer discretionary sector had a slow start to the year but a secondhalf rally by Tesla NASDAQ TSLA and a new record high for Amazon NASDAQ AMZN helped polevault it to a 266 total return in 2024 It contains industries you may have thought were in a different sector For example carmakers like Tesla and legacy automakers fall under the consumer discretionary sector although theres a case to be made that Tesla is more of a technology company and automakers like Ford Motor Company and General Motors are industrial Similarly Amazon and MercadoLibre are techfocused companies in the consumer discretionary sector The sector holds many familiar names like McDonalds Starbucks and Nike Like the other sector ETFs on this list the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF NYSEMKT VCR is fairly topheavy with a combined 457 weighting in Amazon Tesla Home Depot and Lowes Companies Beyond that the fund achieves solid diversification with 298 components It can be highly cyclical Slowdowns in consumer spending can affect home improvement budgets and lead to pullbacks on categories like expensive vacations or dining out Runups in Amazon and Telsa have made the sector more expensive with a PE ratio around the SP 500 average and a yield of just 07 But it can continue producing marketbeating gains if the economy grows reasonably and consumers open up their pocketbooks on discretionary goods and services The communications financials and consumer discretionary sectors include completely different industries But all three sectors can be cyclical and vulnerable to ebbs and flows in the business cycle By knowing the leading components in each sector you can know what to expect from each one based on how different companies perform For example it would be very challenging for the communications sector to beat the SP 500 if there were a major selloff in Alphabet and Meta Similarly Amazon and Tesla could drag down the consumer discretionary sector even if the rest of it does well Its a bad idea to invest in any sector or ETF if youre trying to time the market Betting big on a theme or idea just to make a quick buck is a great way to lose your shirt However if you like a sectors top holdings for their longterm potential buying a lowcost ETF can be a great way to achieve diversification

results Changes in the political landscape in the United States and Canada are raising questions about the future of the tariffs that both countries raised last year on Chinesemade electric vehicles Canada announced 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese EVs in August aligning its policy with the US which had announced them in May The tariffs generated controversy from the outset as trade lawyers questioned whether they comply with World Trade Organization rules and how they could affect Canadas future trade negotiations Now with Justin Trudeau and Joe Biden both exiting their respective leadership positions all eyes are focused on incoming US president Donald Trump who made tariffs on China a defining feature of his first term in office but who is now being advised by Tesla Inc chief executive Elon Musk a vocal opponent of the tariffs on Chinesemade EVs Despite the political turbulence I expect the tariffs to remain both in Canada and the US Brian Kingston president of the Canadian Vehicles Manufacturers Association a lobbying group said Remember these were put in place because there was a clear recognition that our automotive sector cannot be undermined by a subsidized Chinese sector and efforts were taken to make sure Canada was aligned with the US How Musk translates any influence on Trump into actual policies remains to be seen but about half of Teslas global deliveries in 2024 came from a plant in Shanghai Tesla competes quite well in the market in China with no tariffs and no deferential support Im in favour of no tariffs Musk said last May when the US tariffs were introduced Around that time Trump said the tariffs should have included all types of vehicles not just EVs In December Reuters said a Trump transition team document recommended strengthening tariffs on batteries and other battery components made in China but quoted a Trump spokesperson who downplayed those recommendations as coming from outsiders This week the Washington Post said Trump is reconsidering his campaign idea for a universal tariff on all imports and instead is contemplating tariffs on select categories of goods specifically naming batteries and battery components as one area for trade protection Those signs point to Trump keeping the tariffs on Chinesemade EVs as Kingston suggested but policymakers have said his industrial strategy is likely to differ from Bidens in several key ways that could affect tariffs If Biden had raised tariffs as a means to protect North Americas burgeoning EV supply chain because he said it creates wellpaying manufacturing jobs and would help reduce carbon emissions Trump is believed to be far more focused on simply creating jobs On the campaign trail he said he wants to roll back the Inflation Reduction Act the Biden administrations signature climate bill that handed out tens of billions of dollars and has spurred the construction of battery cell manufacturing plants and other parts of the EV battery supply chain throughout the US The question some policymakers are wondering is whether Trump will seek to decouple the supply chain from China or merely derisk it The latter would mean he might be open to investments by Chinese EV makers in manufacturing plants in the US so any negotiations about that could result in lowering or removing the tariffs Obviously Trump has a predisposition toward being protectionist in his policies Francis Fong managing director at TD Economics said But when were talking about climate or cleantech its unclear what Trump is planning on rolling back He said that while Trump has not expressed unequivocal support for the adoption of EVs the factor that motivates his political base is jobs jobs jobs and to the extent tariffs protect US jobs he is likely to keep or even expand them In Canada the auto sector has said that the tariffs on Chinesemade EVs are necessary to protect them from a flood of cheap imports They say that cheap labour and lower environmental standards combined with government subsidies and the risks that Chinese vehicles collect unauthorized data on users create unfair competition Regardless of how a Trump administration treats US tariffs on Chinesemade EVs there is the question of what Canada may do as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau prepares to exit later this year In September China filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization dispute settlement body that challenged Canadas 100 per cent tariffs on its EVs as well as the 25 per cent tariffs on its steel and aluminum that were made at the same time Legally its not shaky legally it does not comply with the rules of the WTO Bernard Colas a trade lawyer in Montreal at Affilia Legal LLP said He said the WTOs proceedings on the Chinese EV tariffs could drag on for several years but he said Canadas lawyers are in a difficult position to craft a defence Typically countries lay the groundwork for such tariffs by conducting an investigation over the course of months Canada could say it needed to invoke tariffs immediately as a matter of national security but that would not be ideal he said Then any other country for any reason could also claim that its also erecting trade barriers for national security and the rulesbased system would fall apart Colas said Its going to backfire because Canada has always relied on a rulesbased system A Parliamentary Budget Office tally earlier this year said at least 524 billion in government funds and 461 billion in private capital have been invested in the countrys EV supply chain What ails Canadas EV sector Anxiety creeps into auto sector as Trump threatens blanket tariffs That means whoever occupies the prime ministers seat next will have to make a difficult decision about whether those investments

picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025 Unsurprisingly many of his choices are among the Magnificent Seven Below Ill explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist Tesla NASDAQ TSLA is probably the most interesting name on Ives list For much of 2024 shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market But beginning in early November shares started going parabolic All told Tesla stock gained 62 in 2024 nearly triple that of the SP 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite The catalyst that fueled Teslas rebound The outcome of the US presidential election During the final months of Donald Trumps campaign Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate Following Trumps victory in early November Ives made it clear that he sees Musks relationship with the presidentelect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla Specifically Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fasttrack Teslas autonomous driving and robotaxi plans While I think Ives outlook makes sense its important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Teslas share price following the election results Is it really surprising to see Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA listed as a top idea for 2025 Last year Nvidia was the topperforming Magnificent Seven stock with shares climbing 171 and the companys valuation gaining more than 2 trillion Despite this unprecedented move Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling This year Nvidias biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup known as Blackwell With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidias new architecture 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader With a 4 trillion valuation within reach investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business I see Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech Over the last two years the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI the developer of ChatGPT Microsoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon Alphabet and Oracle Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit In addition Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AIs next big megatrends agentic AI The companys agentic AI virtual assistant called CoPilot is used by almost 70 of the Fortune 500 To me Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors While Ives has remained bullish on Apple NASDAQ AAPL for some time I have my concerns According to Ives Apples new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense I question how it will play out in reality Apple was late to the AI game and Im not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones Remember Apples consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury If your old iPhone is still manageable Apples AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a highercost device While Id love to be proven wrong on this one Apple is the one stock on this list that Im hesitant about right now To me Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks Ive explored Similar to Microsoft Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AIpowered services from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools advertising streaming consumer hardware and more Alphabet is an extremely diversified business and the companys revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction Yet despite the companys impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities Alphabet only trades at a forward pricetoearnings PE multiple of 219 thats lower than the average forward PE of the SP 500 I think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok While I understand these concerns in theory I think Alphabets financial results depicted above speak for themselves To me an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for

complicated computations that some other conventional systems cannot solve Over the next 5 years more cloud services are expected to offer its clients quantum computing capabilities which should in turn help in cryptography drug development material science and optimization AI and ML are some of the leading technologies behind innovation in the cloud Nasscom Community believes that pervasive AI is expected to be in each layer of the cloud system right from the server level to the customer service level by 2025 Moving forward AI algorithms should help in predictive analysis and therefore prevent problems that can arise with infrastructure control workload and reduce automation of tedious tasks Future developments in the cloud computing field are expected to enhance the multicloud strategies involving using more than one cloud service provider between the business and the cloud altogether Notably distributing workloads among several cloud providers would help enterprises maximize cost and performance The businesses have been dividing their workload across multiple cloud service providers in a bid to control data and resources and use the strength of each cloud service

capabilities Number of Hedge Fund Holders 202 Average Upside Potential 93 Alphabet Inc NASDAQGOOGL is a significant player in the cloud computing space through its subsidiary Google Cloud The companys Al offerings are expected to differentiate its services from competitors which should attract more enterprise customers and drive growth in this highmargin business Alphabet Inc NASDAQGOOGL continues to aggressively integrate Al capabilities into its core offerings which should help enhance user experiences and maintain competitive edge In Q3 2024 Google Cloud revenues rose 35 to 114 billion led by accelerated growth in Google Cloud Platform across Al Infrastructure Generative Al Solutions and core GCP products The synergies between Alphabet Inc NASDAQGOOGLs cloud services and its other Alpowered products are expected to create a strong ecosystem for businesses which should promote deeper integration and longterm customer relationships This can result in increased customer retention and highervalue contracts fueling revenue growth and margin expansion in its cloud segment Several analysts remain optimistic about Alphabet Inc NASDAQGOOGLs cloud business For example JPMorgan

analysts While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and

It climbed 28 while the SP 500 rose 23 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 12 The Nasdaq heavily weighted in technology companies surged as investors piled into the industrys hottest new area artificial intelligence AI stocks Todays 200 billion AI market is forecast to top 1 trillion by the end of the decade and investors have sought to get in early on this highgrowth story The technology has the potential to transform many industries saving companies time and money while boosting earnings as a result And earnings growth often leads to positive stock performance As 2025 gets started its logical to ask this question After two years of gains will the Nasdaq keep up the momentum this year History says it will If we look at the past periods of gains since 1990 in five out of six cases the Nasdaq has climbed for three consecutive years or more Of course the market can surprise us and deviate from a trend but in general history has shown itself to be a solid guide Now lets look at my top AI stocks to buy before the Nasdaq takes off You may associate Meta Platforms NASDAQ META mainly with social media The company owns Facebook Messenger Instagram and WhatsApp which together have more than 32 billion users each day But Meta also is becoming a giant in AI developing its own large language model LLM to support tools we all can use like the Meta AI assistant The company made AI its biggest investment area last year and recently spoke of plans to continue increasing spending in this area It aims to create AI that can assist all of its users with their daily tasks workrelated projects and more This focus and the related investment could eventually make Meta a leader in this hot growth area and boost its revenue too For example the company generates most of its revenue through advertising and AI assistants may prompt us to spend more time on Metas apps encouraging advertisers to spend more to reach us there Considering all of this Meta shares trading at only 24 times forward earnings estimates even after last years 65 gain look like a bargain AI buy to snap up before the Nasdaq soars Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL like Meta may not be a company you automatically associate with AI You probably know it best for Google Search a tool many of us use daily But it is winning in AI in two ways First its LLM Gemini is helping it improve search and make the experience better for those who advertise across Google And second Alphabet offers AI tools and services including Gemini through Google Cloud its cloud computing business The focus on AI has helped Google Cloud reach milestones in recent quarters surpassing 10 billion in revenue and 1 billion in operating income The company does face one risk an antitrust case brought by the Justice Department A US district judge last year ruled Google hurt the competition in search But the company says it will appeal and it may be difficult for the government to apply the strictest of sanctions Like Meta Alphabet stock represents a bargain today trading for 21 times forward earnings estimates especially considering its long track record of growth its market leadership and its focus on AI This list wouldnt be complete without Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA Yes it already soared 171 last year and isnt the cheapest stock on the block at 45 times forward earnings estimates But I think its worth the price and has room to run in light of its position in the AI landscape Nvidia not only is the top AI chip company but it also has built an AI empire spanning various products and services It has even created platforms for particular industries like healthcare and automaking The companys chip dominance has helped it generate double and tripledigit growth quarter after quarter in recent years bringing revenue to record levels Sales topped 35 billion in the latest quarter But the momentum is far from over The company also is set to win in the next wave of AI growth the area of software Its enterprise software and tools that help customers build their own AI agents AI that solves complex problems could push revenue much higher in the years to come So Nvidia the star of the early phase of AI has what it takes to continue shining and thats why it makes a top buy before the Nasdaq soars in 2025 When our analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen After all Stock Advisors total

after another in 2024 The benchmark index ended the year up 23 and that comes on the back of a great 2023 when the index climbed 24 But for many stocks prices have climbed faster than improvements in the underlying fundamentals Investors wouldnt be incorrect to think equities are expensive right now But even in an expensive market there are still opportunities for investors While most of the SP 500s growth was driven by just a handful of megacap growth stocks smaller stocks still present a great opportunity With just 100 investors can buy shares in any of the following growth stocks at a price thats more than fair Uber NYSE UBER is practically synonymous with rideshare service The company holds a dominant position in the market with over 161 million users on its app That customer base creates a network effect attracting more drivers to its platform around the world And Uber has leveraged its network to expand to restaurant and grocery delivery as well as a small freight business Both the ridesharing and delivery business are exhibiting strong growth In the third quarter gross bookings increased 17 and 16 for ridesharing and delivery respectively and the ridesharing business saw significantly improved profitability But several factors have weighed on the company recently Ubers subscription service Uber One came under investigation from the FTC for being too difficult to cancel Additionally the Federal Reserve suggested itll make fewer rate cuts than initially anticipated in 2025 which could increase the cost of carrying debt for Uber It currently has 11 billion on its balance sheet The biggest threat to Uber though is the rise of autonomous vehicles Alphabets Waymo and Tesla are both working on developing ridesharing services using their own autonomous vehicles But Ubers massive scale and user base will be tough to overcome In fact Alphabet decided to partner with Uber to launch its service in Austin and Atlanta Handing off the job of managing customers and a fleet of vehicles to Uber will allow Waymo to grow quickly and focus more on ensuring its vehicles operate as expected The impact of all of that is Uber looks like a good value priced at around 65 per share as of this writing That makes for an enterprise valuetosales ratio of just 34 and a forward pricetoearnings multiple of 28 That said analysts expect sales growth of 16 next year and earnings to grow even faster at 23 thanks to improving profitability With good growth ahead of it investors should be willing to pay that price for Uber stock Etsy NASDAQ ETSY the marketplace operator for unique goods has seen its operations come under pressure over the last two years Its currently undergoing a transition period focused on improving longterm growth in gross merchandise sales But that comes with some nearterm pain Etsy is moving away from optimizing its site for immediate sales instead focusing on the customer experience That includes highlighting the marketplace as a premier destination for gifting and developing a loyalty program It also made some changes on the merchant side of operations to discourage sellers from listing massproduced products that all look alike The results of the efforts are clear The shortterm pain came in the form of a 41 drop in gross merchandise sales Etsy offset that pressure with a higher take rate thanks to shifting to its own payments platform increasing advertising service sales and a small store setup fee to help ensure merchants comply with Etsys focus on unique goods Etsy is doing a great job of managing its business amid a decrease in discretionary spending Consumers stricken by higher prices for essentials like housing groceries and clothing pulled back on discretionary expenses However spending intentions are on the rise again and Etsy could see a strong recovery in sales as consumers loosen their purse strings in 2025 With a share price of 53 as of this writing Etsy stock trades for 20 times analysts expectations for 2025 earnings While its certainly a more risky stock investors are getting a good value at todays price to take that risk Investors will have to remain patient with Etsy as its more cyclical than many retailers But if its efforts to promote longterm customer growth and loyalty work out it should see substantial gains over the long run DraftKings NASDAQ DKNG is one of two dominant online sports betting and iGaming companies in North America Online gambling is growing quickly in America with analysts expecting revenue to double between 2023 and 2029 as more states legalize sports betting and iGaming DraftKings is wellpositioned to take advantage of the growth in the market despite the recent launches of smaller competitors Thats because DraftKings has a couple of advantages First it has a strong brand name and it works with major sports franchises and entertainment networks to maintain that strength Second and perhaps more importantly its scale provides it with a data advantage over smaller competitors Data is essential for sportsbook operators Its the lifeblood of setting accurate lines ensuring the house has an advantage Data can help identify sharp bettors and mitigate risks of losing to them It can also help develop new products like live betting player props and samegame parlays And it can offer better promotions to keep bettors engaged with its product The growing market and DraftKings advantages led to strong results in 2024 In the 12 months ending in September 93 million people used one of DraftKings products Thats up 41 year over year

for the gig economy You were part of that movement if your work was done online or if your jobs were assigned by a central platform in the cloud Ive been living that life for nearly two decades now popular examples of this digital labor approach include the Uber NYSE UBER ridesharing service and the Fiverr International NYSE FVRR gigconnecting service for digital freelancers But the term found a new life in the last two years When the ChatGPT artificial intelligence AI platform came along some would call it digital labor when a human crafted effective prompts to be fed into generative AI systems And now the AI revolution is taking the next logical step in 2025 digital labor often refers to automated AI agents that can set their own tasks and plan out complex data management activities This form of digital labor can help people achieve more with less work Critics argue that its a slippery slope perhaps leading up to selfaware AI systems with dangerous priorities Is digital labor the first step into a better future or is the Terminator movie franchises SkyNet coming up next First of all the AI industry is a long way away from selfaware machines ChatGPT may be good at summarizing long texts and its sister service DallE 3 usually puts the right number of fingers on people in its generated images but thats as far as it goes Even the best image generators often get basic details wrong in 2025 Ive seen a ton of AIgenerated text made by the best large language models LLMs with expertly crafted prompts and highly specific highquality data The results are still repetitive clumsy and full of incorrect analysis Tech giants like Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Tesla NASDAQ TSLA have been working on selfdriving cars for years These systems get better all the time but truly

also far away OpenAI CEO Sam Altman currently expects computers to match human creativity in the 2030s but experts have been overly optimistic about longterm targets before Wheres my flying car you know Quantum computing could accelerate this progress as nonbinary calculations can find patterns in the noisy data of life much faster than oldschool computers But it will take a very powerful quantum computer to make meaningful contributions in areas like AGI humanlike creativity and robots that can act like ordinary people McKinsey researchers expect thousands of usable quantum computers by the year 2030 but truly complex problems will still be out of reach until 2035 or 2040 So the world is about 10 years away from an avalanche of gamechanging leaps in the AI and quantum computing realms Im looking forward to that sea change in human progress and I can only hope that the new systems are developed with longterm security in mind Isaac Asimovs three laws of robotics should be a

usually the same megacap tech stocks or some combination of a handful of big tech companies One artificial intelligence ETF that is different from the rest is the Ark Autonomous Technology Robotics ETF NYSEMKT ARKQ Heres what it does and why you might want to take a closer look There are several exchangetraded funds or ETFs that are focused on AI stocks and some are excellent investment products with reasonable fees But the Ark Autonomous Technology Robotics ETF does things a little differently For one thing instead of being an index fund aiming to match the performance of an AI stock index over time Arks funds are all actively managed This means that they have portfolio managers notable tech investor Cathie Wood analyzing and selecting stocks with the goal of doing better than the benchmark AI indexes Because of this the ETFs portfolio is a little more concentrated than most with just 35 stocks And not only that but the list of stocks doesnt look remotely like what some of the major AI index funds own Just to name a couple examples The iShares Future AI Tech ETF NYSEMKT ARTY has Broadcom NASDAQ AVGO Arista Networks NYSE ANET and Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA as its top three positions The Invesco AI and Next Gen Software ETF NYSEMKT IGPT has its top three positions as Nvidia Alphabet NASDAQ GOOGL NASDAQ GOOG and Meta Platforms NASDAQ META If youre at all familiar with the technology sector none of these should be too much of a surprise Most AI index funds are weighted in favor of the megacap players Dont get me wrong Nvidia Alphabet Broadcom and the others are great companies But I could also get lots of concentrated exposure to them by simply buying a Nasdaq100 index fund To be sure the top holding of the Ark Autonomous Technology Robotics ETF is Tesla NASDAQ TSLA a company youre probably quite familiar with However the rest of the top five consists of Teradyne NASDAQ TER Kratos Defense Security NASDAQ KTOS Rocket Lab USA NASDAQ RKLB and Archer Aviation NYSE ACHR Just to familiarize you Teradyne is a 23 billion market cap robotics company Kratos develops products and software mainly for the defense industry and has a market cap just over 4 billion Rocket Lab has a 14 billion market cap and develops spacecraft and related components Archer Aviation is valued at about 48 billion and develops electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft For context these four stocks have a combined market cap that is just over 1 of Nvidias But this Ark ETF has more than 31 of its assets invested in them The key takeaway is that the Ark Autonomous Technology Robotics ETF is a great way to get AI exposure if you dont want to just invest in the usual suspects There are large positions in some outsidethebox small and midcap stocks that have home run potential Its also important to note that while the funds 075 expense ratio is high compared to say an SP 500 index fund it isnt much higher than youd pay for a passive AI ETF I recently did an analysis of some of the most popular AI index funds and their expense ratios ranged from 047 to 068 So for not much more youll get one of the most respected tech investors handselecting the best AI opportunities Before you buy stock in Ark ETF Trust Ark Autonomous Technology Robotics ETF consider this The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best

specific company name for relevant results 2024 was a phenomenal year for most megacap growth stocks which helped lead broader indexes like the SP 500 SNPINDEX GSPC to new heights Still some investors may be concerned that the rally is a bit overextended Even weak companies can see their stock prices rise when investors are optimistic However over time the bestperforming stocks are businesses that deliver on investor expectations and continue to innovate So with the SP 500 around an alltime high ensuring you are investing in quality companies is imperative Investing in dividend stocks is a way to collect passive income no matter what equity prices are doing Heres why Broadcom NASDAQ AVGO Visa NYSE V Salesforce NYSE CRM Meta Platforms NASDAQ META and Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL are well positioned as industryleading companies that can afford to raise their dividends through economic cycles and periods of volatility In their most recent quarterly earnings results Broadcom and Visa announced significant increases to their dividends for 2025 Broadcom hiked its payout by 11 and Visa boosted its dividend by 13 I would expect both companies to announce hikes of 10 or more again toward the end of this year Broadcom and Visa are textbook examples of dividendpaying growth stocks Both companies have impeccable business models Broadcom has network connectivity and artificial intelligence AI and Visa has a global payment processing network for debit and credit cards Since Broadcom and Visa are growing their sales and operating income at impressive rates they can afford to pass along a portion of profits to investors through dividends Over the last five years Broadcom has increased its dividend by 815 and Visa has nearly doubled its payout However the dividend payment isnt so large that it soaks up too much excess capital Longterm investors would prefer Broadcom rapidly expand its AI product lineup rather than divert precious capital toward a bloated dividend Visa reinvests in its business too but it spends the bulk of its capital return program on buybacks rather than dividends Visas relentless buybacks have reduced the companys share count by 11 in the last five years helping the company grow earnings per share faster than net income to help keep its valuation reasonable Broadcom yields just 12 and Visa yields 08 The low yields are due to substantial gains in both stocks not a lack of commitment to boosting payouts Meta Platforms Salesforce and Alphabet all began paying dividends in 2024 Meta initiated its dividend on Feb 1 when it reported its fourthquarter and fullyear 2023 results Salesforce announced its dividend on Feb 28 when it reported fourthquarter and fullyear fiscal 2024 results Alphabet announced its first dividend when it reported firstquarter 2024 results on April 25 I would expect all four companies to make regularly scheduled dividend raises once per year around the same time as their initial announcements fourthquarter earnings for Meta and Salesforce and firstquarter earnings for Alphabet All three stocks have yields of 05 or less at the time of this writing but I would expect all three companies to make annual doubledigit percentage raises for years to come and transform into dividendgrowth stocks like Broadcom and Visa All three companies are highly profitable and generate tons of free cash flow FCF despite ramping spending on AI FCF yield is a useful way of determining a companys theoretical payout if it passed along all of its FCF to investors through dividends Similar to dividend yield FCF yield is just FCF per share divided by the share price or total FCF divided by market cap Like dividend yield FCF yield goes down as a stock price goes up Salesforce Meta and Alphabet beat the SP 500 in 2024 which brought down their FCF yields However despite the big year and record research and development expenses all three companies still have solid FCF yields Each company can afford to substantially raise its payout and support it with cash without slowing down spending on longterm growth Broadcom Visa Salesforce Meta and Alphabet may not light up an income investors radar However dont be surprised if all five companies grow their payouts at impressive rates for years to come For now each companys dividend is merely the cherry on top of an already solid underlying investment thesis Investors looking to supplement income in retirement would do better with higheryielding stocks with multidecade track records of increasing payouts But investors who are more focused on total returns capital gains plus dividends than dividends alone should focus on a companys ability to grow earnings and in turn its dividend over time instead of what the yield is today Broadcom Visa Salesforce Meta and Alphabet have runways for future earnings growth making them dividendgrowth stocks worth considering in 2025 Before you buy stock in Broadcom consider this The Motley

company name for relevant results Quantum computing was one of the hot trends of the past few months as stocks have doubled or more following Alphabets NASDAQ GOOG Willow announcement Investors looking for any way to play the quantum computing space have pushed microcap stocks into the stratosphere Then NVIDIA NASDAQ NVDA CEO Jensen Huang who is revered in the tech industry had some dismissive comments about the industry That sent shares sharply lower According to data provided by SP Global Market Intelligence IonQ NYSE IONQ plunged 323 this week Quantum Computing NASDAQ QUBT was down 487 and DWave Quantum NYSE QBTS was down 369 The drop in stocks came after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huangs QA with analysts at CES in Las Vegas When answering a question about the future of quantum computing he said the timeline may be between 15 and 30 years until there is very useful quantum computers This is the relevant quote from Huang if you kind of said 15 years for very useful quantum computers thatd probably be on the early side If you said 30 is probably on the late side But if you picked 20 I think a whole bunch of us would believe it To be clear Huang didnt say quantum computing was a pipe dream In fact he said Nvidia is working with nearly every quantum computing company in the world But he thinks the current expectations for nearterm revenue growth may be overblown The statement brought pushback from fans of quantum computing but its hard to argue against the idea that were many years from quantum computing being a meaningful business Despite multibilliondollar market caps before this weeks drop IonQ Quantum Computing and DWave had combined revenue of under 50 million over the past 12 months The fundamentals dont back up the valuation which isnt surprising for earlystage technology The question now is about when this will become a real business One person pushing back on Huangs thoughts is IonQs CEO Peter Chapman who said today We believe that IonQ will be profitable with sales approaching 1 billion by 2030 A 1 billion revenue target that he believes is achievable doesnt exactly disprove Huangs thesis Thats still a relatively small business and IonQ trades for 7 times 2030 revenue if IonQ can reach the 1 billion revenue level by then as the CEO hopes He also highlighted the bigger problem which is that big tech including Nvidia one of the industry leaders has invested 50 billion in quantum technologies IonQ may be a pure play but it may not have the biggest quantum business in 15 to 30 years Quantum computing may very well be a revolutionary technology in the future and that may lead to multiple large businesses But theres a lot of risk given the lack of revenue and commercial applications today Its natural for stocks that have gone up this much in a short period of time to have major pullbacks and thats what we see with quantum computing stocks this week With major commercial applications potentially a decade away I wouldnt be surprised if they pull back further in the future Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks Then youll want to hear this On rare occasions our

company by Jan 19 Most Read from Bloomberg What Robotaxis Brought San Francisco A Blueprint for Better Bike Lanes Ambitious HighSpeed Rail Plans Advance in the Baltic Region NYC Condo Owners May Bear Costs of Landmark Green Building Law New York San Francisco Ranked Worst for US Traffic in City Centers Hearing arguments in Washington a majority of justices suggested they see US national security concerns as overriding the free speech interests of the companies and content creators Several justices cast the law as being focused not on speech but on ByteDance Ltd the parent company that Congress concluded has dangerously close ties with Chinas Communist government Are we supposed to ignore the fact that the ultimate parent is in fact subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government Chief Justice John Roberts asked TikToks lawyer during a session that lasted more than 2 12 hours Friday TikTok Hearing at US Supreme Court TOPLive Transcript A decision upholding the ban would open a tumultuous period for TikTok ByteDance and the videosharing apps 170 million US users ByteDance so far has insisted it wont consider a sale but the company could revisit that stance if a ban is imminent The law applies to technology companies including Apple Inc Oracle Corp and Alphabet Incs Google that host and distribute TikTok threatening them with potentially massive fines if they continue to do so The platform wouldnt immediately disappear for users but because it will no longer be updated its performance in all likelihood would slowly deteriorate Huge Concern The Biden administration is defending the law as a national security imperative saying that Chinese control of TikTok will let a foreign adversary spread propaganda covertly manipulate the platform and collect Americans data for espionage or blackmail purposes Just on the data collection that seems like a huge concern for the future of the country Justice Brett Kavanaugh said to TikToks lawyer Noel Francisco President Joe Biden signed the measure into law in April after it won approval from a bipartisan majority in Congress TikTok and ByteDance say lawmakers gave short shrift to speech rights The companies contend that foreign influence concerns are unfounded arguing that TikTok Inc is an American company incorporated and headquartered in California A group of content creators is also urging the court to strike down the law saying a ban would strip millions of Americans of their ability to speak to and hear from communities they have come to value Justice Clarence Thomas voiced skepticism toward those arguments The law doesnt say anything about creators or people who use the site he said Its only concerned about the ownership and the concerns that data will be manipulated or there will be other national security problems with someone whos not a citizen of this country or a company whos not here Only Justice Neil Gorsuch indicated he was a likely vote to strike down the law Gorsuch called the governments defense of the law paternalistic and asked why Congress couldnt have just required TikTok to post a warning telling users about the risk of Chinese manipulation Dont we normally assume that the best remedy for problematic speech is counterspeech he asked US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar the administrations top Supreme Court lawyer Matthew Schettenhelm an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence lowered the chance of a TikTok win to 20 from 30 after the argument Going Dark Much of the argument concerned what would happen should the law kick in as scheduled Francisco TikToks lawyer said the platform would go dark at that point Essentially the platform shuts down he said But Prelogar the solicitor general said the ban would end as soon as ByteDance sells the platform in a way that meets the laws requirements When push comes to shove and these restrictions take effect I think it will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what ByteDance is willing to consider she said The Jan 20 presidential inauguration of Donald Trump will add a new element Trump who once supported a ban but now says he opposes it asked the Supreme Court last month to take the unorthodox step of blocking the law so he can broker a settlement Trumps Justice Department would have authority to enforce the law and as president he would have power to approve any divestment proposal and potentially block the law in the meantime Company Risk Queried by Kavanaugh Prelogar said Trump could choose not to enforce the law But Kavanaugh then questioned whether Oracle Apple and other companies subject to the law would continue providing services for TikTok in that scenario Theyre not going to take that risk unless they have the assurance that a presidential statement of nonenforcement is in fact something that can be fully relied on because the risk is too severe otherwise right Kavanaugh asked Prelogar said the companies might have a sufficient safeguard here to allow them to continue to operate Justice Samuel Alito suggested the court could issue an administrative stay of the effective date but no other justice indicated interest in that idea The Supreme Court put the case on a fast track after TikTok and the content creators asked for the ban to be put on hold temporarily The justices instead scheduled a special session that gives them time to issue a definitive ruling on the laws constitutionality before Jan 19 The court could also issue an interim order saying whether the law can take effect on Jan 19 while giving itself more time to rule on the merits of the case with a full opinion The cases are TikTok v Garland 24656 and Firebaugh v Garland 24657 With assistance from Alexandra S Levine Sabrina Willmer and Emily Birnbaum

support that growth Ill get to Vistras role in a moment first a few words on how nuclear power became popular in 2024 There is a critical need to secure a longterm reliable power source for data centers and nuclear power is increasingly seen as the answer Nuclear power is seen as a carbonfree way to ensure reliable power and it has become even more popular considering renewable energys difficulties in recent years including surging costs logistics issues and supply chain constraints Indeed its no coincidence that the most significant three cloud service providers signed deals with nuclear power producers in 2024 Microsoft inked a longterm power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy to restart part of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant Alphabets Google signed a deal to buy nuclear energy from small modular reactors SMR developed by Kairos Power Meanwhile Amazons Amazon Web Services paid 650 million to buy a data center campus from Talen Energy and signed a longterm deal to buy power from Talens nearby nuclear plant Amazon also signed deals to support the development of SMRs While the AmazonTalen deal received a blow when the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected a proposal allowing Talen to sell more power to Amazon the IT giant has subsequently reaffirmed its commitment to the original equipment The company started the year with only 2400 megawatts MW of its 36702 MW of generating capacity coming from nuclear but significantly added to that figure with the completion of a deal to acquire Energy Harbor in March adding 4000 MW of nuclear generation capacity Vistra would then acquire the remaining 15 it didnt own in Vistra Vision which held its nuclear assets among others The deal was perfect timing and investors now anticipate that

the first time the index posted backtoback years of 20 gains or higher since the 1990s There are 11 stock market sectors but only three beat the SP 500 last year communications financials and consumer discretionary Even the technology sector underperformed the SP 500 last year In fact only 148 SP 500 components beat the index last year meaning over 70 of components underperformed the index Heres why these three standout sectors did well last year how they can carry the momentum forward this year and lowcost exchangetraded funds ETFs you can use to invest in each sector Communications was the bestperforming sector last year producing a 348 total return capital gains plus dividends The sector was led by its three highestweighted components Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Meta Platforms NASDAQ META and Netflix NASDAQ NFLX which rose 355 654 and 831 respectively in 2024 Besides social media and streaming companies the sector has traditional media giants like Comcast and Walt Disney telecom companies and more Despite running up in 2023 and 2024 the sector remains a good value going into 2025 Legacy media companies and telecom titans tend to pay dividends and feature inexpensive valuations Even Alphabet and Meta have reasonable valuations because they generate tons of free cash flow and solid earnings growth The sector depends heavily on advertising and consumer spending So a downturn in those categories could result in slowing growth and even a sectorwide selloff But the longterm outlook for the sector is encouraging especially given Metas success with monetizing Instagram and Netflixs expanding margins and pricing power Vanguard offers lowcost sectorbased ETFs with 01 expense ratios The Vanguard Communications ETF NYSEMKT VOX mirrors the sectors performance making it a simple yet effective tool for investing in stocks like Alphabet and Meta The financial sector was a standout winner in 2024 The sector includes Berkshire Hathaway big banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley regional banks payment processors like Visa Mastercard and American Express insurance companies and more The sector has done well amid relatively higher interest rates Banks can see expanded net interest margins during periods of higher rates because the difference between the rates they collect on lending like mortgages and car loans and what they pay on deposits and savings accounts widens But higher interest rates can also slow economic growth Last year stood out because economic growth was solid despite higher rates Integrated banks and investment banks thrived with many of those companies seeing record profits and stock prices Payment processors like Visa had slowing growth but were remarkably resilient thanks to network effects that led to moderate earnings growth despite pressured consumer spending The financials sector has run up a considerable amount so it isnt as compelling a value as it used to be But relative to the SP 500 it is still a decent value The Vanguard Financials ETF NYSEMKT VFH features a 171 pricetoearnings ratio PE and a 16 dividend yield compared to a 271 PE and a 12 yield for the Vanguard SP 500 ETF NYSEMKT VOO Economic slowdowns can affect the sector making it cyclical So investors should be aware of the potential volatility before diving headfirst into the Vanguard Financials ETF The consumer discretionary sector had a slow start to the year but a secondhalf rally by Tesla NASDAQ TSLA and a new record high for Amazon NASDAQ AMZN helped polevault it to a 266 total return in 2024 It contains industries you may have thought were in a different sector For example carmakers like Tesla and legacy automakers fall under the consumer discretionary sector although theres a case to be made that Tesla is more of a technology company and automakers like Ford Motor Company and General Motors are industrial Similarly Amazon and MercadoLibre are techfocused companies in the consumer discretionary sector The sector holds many familiar names like McDonalds Starbucks and Nike Like the other sector ETFs on this list the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF NYSEMKT VCR is fairly topheavy with a combined 457 weighting in Amazon Tesla Home Depot and Lowes Companies Beyond that the fund achieves solid diversification with 298 components It can be highly cyclical Slowdowns in consumer spending can affect home improvement budgets and lead to pullbacks on categories like expensive vacations or dining out Runups in Amazon and Telsa have made the sector more expensive with a PE ratio around the SP 500 average and a yield of just 07 But it can continue producing marketbeating gains if the economy grows reasonably and consumers open up their pocketbooks on discretionary goods and services The communications financials and consumer discretionary sectors include completely different industries But all three sectors can be cyclical and vulnerable to ebbs and flows in the business cycle By knowing the leading components in each sector you can know what to expect from each one based on how different companies perform For example it would be very challenging for the communications sector to beat the SP 500 if there were a major selloff in Alphabet and Meta Similarly Amazon and Tesla could drag down the consumer discretionary sector even if the rest of it does well Its a bad idea to invest in any sector or ETF if youre trying to time the market Betting big on a theme or idea just to make a quick buck is a great way to lose your shirt However if you like a sectors top holdings for their longterm potential buying a lowcost ETF can be a great way to achieve diversification Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the

could be the greatest gamechanging technology ever However some believe quantum computing will be even bigger than AI Autonomous ridehailing services commonly known as robotaxis could bring another

Alphabets other products use AI extensively While classical computers use bits 0s or 1s quantum computers use qubits quantum bits that can be 0 1 or both simultaneously They can also be entangled with other qubits that are far away These characteristics hold the potential for quantum computers to process more information much more quickly than classical computers Googles recent introduction of its new Willow chip could be a key breakthrough in developing a useful largescale quantum computer Alphabets Waymo unit is at the head of the pack in offering robotaxi services Waymo already offers autonomous ridehailing in Los Angeles Phoenix and San Francisco Its planning to soon expand into Austin Atlanta and Miami Sure there have been a few highly publicized glitches with Waymos service including an incident where one of its robotaxis drove around in circles in a parking lot repeatedly However the selfdriving technology is usually reliable and continues to improve Investors shouldnt dismiss the potential for Waymo to become a major growth driver for Alphabet over the next few years AI should serve as a key tailwind for all the Magnificent Seven stocks Some of them could be winners in quantum computing as well notably including Amazon Microsoft and Nvidia Amazon Nvidia and Tesla are focusing on the robotaxi market in different ways But none of the other Magnificent Seven

that Google broke antitrust laws by creating an illegal monopoly in the search engine market Google is also embroiled in antitrust litigation related to its digital advertising practices Second some believe that generative AI presents a huge threat perhaps even an existential one to Google Search However Google is appealing the decision about its alleged monopoly in search Some legal experts believe the companys case is strong and expect relatively narrow remedies rather than major changes that hurt its business As for the generative AI threat Google Search already incorporates genAI with its AI Overviews Googles advertising revenue from search continues to grow Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai stated in the companys thirdquarter earnings call that the new feature is increasing search usage and user satisfaction He added The integration of ads within AI Overviews is also performing well helping people connect with businesses as they search Perhaps these issues could become greater problems for Alphabet but Im optimistic that they wont I think Alphabets leadership in AI quantum computing and robotaxis make it one of the best Magnificent Seven stocks to buy right now Ever

Term In this article we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc NASDAQGOOGL stands against the other technology stocks On January 1 King Lip BakerAvenue Wealth Managements chief strategist and partner joined CNBCs Closing Bell to discuss market outlooks as we enter 2025 His focus was on the impressive performance of tech stocks in 2024 with expectations for a second consecutive year of doubledigit gains Lip was against the prevailing sentiment among investors that big tech has peaked and that funds should rotate into smaller stocks or other themes He argued that the recent weakness in the tech sector is largely due to technical rebalancing rather than a fundamental downturn He emphasized that cash is likely to flow back into leading tech stocks as they are projected to deliver the highest earnings growth in 2025 with an anticipated earnings increase of over 20 Discussing high valuations in the tech sector particularly for largecap stocks trading at forward earnings multiples between 32 and 35 times Lip countered that many valuations remain within one standard deviation of their historical norms over the past decade He pointed out that the MAG7 have consistently provided strong returns and are wellpositioned for future growth Lip identified Broadcom as a top stock praising its management under Hock Tan and its unique role in the market as a provider of custom AI chips He noted that the company operates at a lower earnings multiple while benefiting from substantial growth Lip also discussed Palantir which has garnered attention for its profitability and positive cash flow since becoming profitable two years ago despite its high valuation exceeding 50 times revenue he believes it is wellpositioned to benefit from government spending cuts and AI initiatives While acknowledging concerns about insider selling and high valuations for the company Lip remains optimistic about its future potential suggesting it could be more appealing if it drops to the mid60 range Lip is bullish on tech stocks in 2025 that will be driven by strong earnings growth and ongoing investments in AI infrastructure The NASDAQ 100 index has performed remarkably well

Desk also released an adfocused operating system for connected TV sets and formed several new partnerships in the digital advertising market The digital ad sector started a deep downturn in 2022 as the inflation crisis undermined every marketing budget Why spend big money on targeted ads when nobody is ready to buy your goods Adbased revenue streams dried up driving stock prices lower across the

on Wall Street expect to see the first 4 trillion company sometime in 2025 Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA has seen its value soar amid rampant artificial intelligence AI spending as big tech companies race to build out bigger data centers and train more advanced AI models With big tech planning to spend even more in 2025 its strong results should continue Its market cap climbed from 416 billion the day OpenAI released ChatGPT to 343 trillion as of this writing The only company Nvidia trails in size is Apple NASDAQ AAPL which has long sat at or near the top of the worlds most valuable companies Apples massive iPhone user base has supported a growing services business over the past decade and AI could propel that services business in 2025 as it integrates more advanced capabilities into its iOS and macOS operating systems Its market cap sits at 367 trillion as of this writing Meanwhile Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT is leading in AI on two fronts An early investment in OpenAI gave it the integrations it needed to sell developers on its Azure cloud computing platform Azure sales have accelerated as a result and management expects that trend to continue in 2025 Meanwhile Microsofts leading position in enterprise productivity software and PC operating systems gives it a huge market for its Copilot AI agents which help improve accuracy and worker productivity It has a market cap of 316 trillion as of this writing Any of the above could become the first 4 trillion company in 2025 But one company could leapfrog them on the path to 5 trillion by the end of the decade The big reason for all of the excitement around AI is its ability to transform multiple industries And one company has its hand in several of those industries Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Thats why it could be the first company to reach a 5 trillion valuation Amazon is one of the biggest investors in AI Management said during its thirdquarter earnings call in September that it expected to spend 75 billion on capital expenditures in 2024 The majority of that spending will go toward its cloud computing business Amazon Web Services AWS and other technology infrastructure Some will go toward the continued buildout of its logistics network Amazons spending is absolutely massive but its proven to be well worth the price Even while investing more than any other big tech company its generating record amounts of free cash flow Free cash flow climbed to 477 billion over the trailing 12 months in Q3 more than doubling year over year Those strong financial results are driven by Amazons diverse operations AWS has been a strong driving force AWS sales accelerated in 2024 increasing 19 year over year in Q3 Moreover AWS now has substantial scale which shows up in operating income growth of 49 in Q3 AWS growth is powered by Amazons support for advanced AI development across multiple foundation models It continues to work on more efficient custombuilt AI accelerators for training and inference which give its customers lowercost options compared to Nvidias chips Meanwhile the core of Amazon has always been its ecommerce business Amazon continues to grow its share of ecommerce year after year despite strong competition from bigbox retailers improving their online operations and ultracheap alternatives like Temu and Shein The main reason Amazon has proved so successful at defending and expanding its lead is its Prime membership Prime subscriptions give customers free oneday shipping on millions of items on Amazons marketplace along with various other benefits including Prime Video The growth of Prime is a virtuous cycle whereby more members attract more merchants offering a wider variety of goods in turn attracting more Prime members Amazons subscription services revenue continues to climb at a doubledigit pace despite its high penetration rate among consumers Amazon isnt just standing by and letting the flywheel spin Its actively pushing It overhauled its logistics operations in 2023 to focus on multiple regions throughout the United States It uses advanced algorithms that predict demand and monitor instock levels to ensure items remain in stock across each region The new regionalized network forms the foundation of a burgeoning logistics services business as well Finally Amazons strong position in ecommerce has helped it build a massive digital advertising business Ad sales totaled 536 billion over the trailing 12 months Amazon should be able to sustain that pace as it expands video advertising all Prime memberships include adsupported streaming by default Generative AI has the potential to supercharge ad sales on Amazon especially considering Amazons scale and data which can fuel iterative testing for ad campaigns ensuring better conversions for merchants Amazons business is operated with one key metric in mind longterm freecashflow generation To that end its been a wild success As mentioned free cash flow totaled 477 billion over the last 12 months Thats up from about 1 billion 10 years ago Over the next five years free cash flow could climb even higher AWS fueled by the growth of AI is showing strong improvements in operating income Despite the massive spending to build out new data centers develop its own chips and attract new customers with improvements to the platform growth is outpacing the increased spending Moreover Amazon is currently undergoing a massive investment cycle The 75 billion in expected 2024 capital expenditures is a new record for the company Its likely to increase further in 2025 But eventually that spending will plateau At that point Amazon will reap what its sown across AWS its logistics network and its ecommerce business which fuels its advertising business That cycle has played out multiple times for Amazon over the last 30 years Historically Amazon has traded around 50 times free cash flow At that multiple it would be worth 5 trillion once it produces 100 billion in free cash flow That may happen sooner than investors expect given the strong growth in free cash flow looks poised to continue soaring through the end of the decade Before you buy stock in Amazon

results Sign in to access your portfolio","Tip Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results Last year investors focused on companies crucial to the development of a hot newish technology artificial intelligence AI These players like Nvidia Broadcom or Super Micro Computer produce chips or equipment such as servers for data centers the place where AI development begins After all its necessary to train large language models before they can actually do the job of solving problems and executing tasks And these companies should continue to see growth ahead as there is plenty more AI training and data center buildout to be done At the same time another area of AI may share the spotlight this year and this has to do with the idea of putting AI to work Im talking about the development and use of AI agents These are AIs that help companies or industries with complex tasks that involve reasoning and taking action on that reasoning Several companies are progressing in the area of AI agents right now but my prediction is one in particular will be one of the biggest winners of the AI agent boom Lets check out this stock to buy now First though lets take a closer look at the potential of AI agents These are software programs that can interact with a human consider a problem use data to develop a solution and act on it They can be used in just about any field for instance insurers could use them for initial queries and the processing of certain claims or the travel industry might use them for reservations and customer support And each operation makes the agent smarter because data from it is fed back into the system The idea is these agents can accomplish certain tasks then escalate to a human for highly complex operations This frees up the humans in various departments allowing them to work on other projects a huge boost to efficiency and a great way for companies to save money The AI agent market at a compound annual growth rate of more than 44 is expected to reach 47 billion by 2030 according to Markets and Markets data So which company is heading for an AI agent victory in this highgrowth market My prediction is Amazon NASDAQ AMZN will be one of the biggest winners and this is because the company will benefit from the technology in two different ways as a user of agentic AI and a seller of tools to develop AI agents Lets consider the AI agent use opportunity first Amazon is a leader in ecommerce with a massive fulfillment network worldwide and here AI agents could play a key role in boosting efficiency and customer and seller satisfaction and this should support earnings growth over time Amazon already has taken the first steps in this direction launching Project Amelia a chatbot to help sellers improve their businesses Initially sellers can ask questions like how should I prepare my store for the holiday season or might ask for updates on their stores traffic and sales data Progressively Project Amelia will offer answers to complex questions solve problems and take action making itself a true AI agent The companys Amazon Web Services AWS is the worlds top cloud computing player and this is where Amazon can benefit from selling tools AWS makes it simple for developers to build their own AI agents suiting their business needs thanks to its Amazon Bedrock platform the creation of an agent requires only a few steps So here Amazon makes it easy for others to get in on this opportunity to become more efficient And since AWS already is the market leader potential customers are right there ready to use the platform to start their AI agent journey Amazon isnt new to the general AI market the company already uses many AI tools across its ecommerce business and sells everything from chips to AI services through AWS And the work is bearing fruit Last year AWS reached a 110 billion annual revenue run rate thanks to sales of AI products and services Now as AI agents gain momentum I would expect AWS and Amazon as a whole to benefit And thats why I predict this player will be one of the biggest success stories of this new wave of AI growth Before you buy stock in Amazon consider this The Motley Fool

high levels of growth amid its leadership in ecommerce cloud computing and more recently artificial intelligence AI Nonetheless with a market cap now of over 23 trillion it is likely approaching a point at which highpercentage growth will become more difficult Thus investors may want to consider other consumeroriented stocks that can more easily turn market potential into more rapid growth The following two stocks hold the potential to generate higher returns than the ecommerce and cloud giant Admittedly an energy drink that is No 3 in the market is not an obvious place to look for an outperforming stock However investors need to take a closer look at Celsius NASDAQ CELH It stands out by marketing itself as using natural ingredients That approach helped it win a following with health enthusiasts Sales levels also became supercharged after it signed a distribution deal with PepsiCo That increased its availability allowing outlets such as Amazon and Costco to sell its energy drinks in large quantities Unfortunately distribution issues caused its stock to fall more than 70 from its high last year as a major distributor likely PepsiCo drastically reduced its orders Nonetheless the distributor will probably rightsize its orders in the future likely making this issue less of a factor Moreover sales of 1 billion in the first three quarters of 2024 managed to grow 5 While that is dramatically slower than the 104 yearly growth in the first nine months of 2023 it still constitutes an increase Additionally international purchases only made up 5 of Celsius revenue in the first nine months of 2024 Still sales grew by a combined 38 annually in the Europe and AsiaPacific regions in the first nine months of the year Given the growth potential of these markets overall sales growth should improve as the companys nonNorth American markets claim a higher percentage of the sales Furthermore the stock price decline has taken its PE ratio to 41 a level just off multiyear lows Assuming overall sales increases can at least match its international growth rate over time Celsius stock will probably move on from the recent distribution disruptions and resume its march higher Alternatively if investors prefer to outperform Amazon within its own industries they may want to turn to the company widely perceived as the Amazon of China Alibaba NYSE BABA Admittedly fear of another trade war with the US has depressed the stocks of Chinabased companies despite Alibabas lack of exposure to the US Also a slowing economy in China coupled with almost 38 billion in fines between 2021 and 2023 for regulatory violations weighed significantly on its stock However given Alibabas performance one has to wonder whether the selloff is overdone The stock is down by almost 75 from its alltime high in 2020 and is even down 10 from its IPO in 2014 That decline has left it with a PE ratio of just 17 far less than Amazon which trades at 48 times earnings amid significant multiple compression Also with Alibabas forward PE ratio of just 10 investors may not fully appreciate the growth it is likely to experience Indeed one could argue Alibaba has become cheap for a reason Its revenue in the first six months of fiscal 2024 was 68 billion a gain of 5 from yearago levels This is a dramatic pullback from the same period in 2021 when yearly revenue growth was 31 Still the nearly 10 billion in net income for the first six months of 2024 surged 13 higher from yearago levels Hence even with more muted growth levels Alibabas profits appear to be rising too fast to justify its rockbottom forward PE ratio That factor alone could spark rapid stock price growth if negative sentiment surrounding Alibaba fades over the course of the year Ever feel like you missed

harness the power of artificial intelligence AI to supercharge its cloud platform 2025 is starting off strong but you should buy stocks that have longterm potential Lets see where Amazon might be five years from now Amazon has been steadily gaining market share in ecommerce over the past few years and eMarketer expects it to have surpassed 40 of total US ecommerce sales in 2024 It got a lot of competition from smaller companies that went online early in the pandemic but it has improved its logistics networks and done a lot of other things to reinforce its top position and expand its lead It recently switched from a national to a regional warehouse system and thats important as physical store chains use their physical footprint as a distribution channel Both Walmart and Costco Wholesale are leveraging their many stores all over the country to ship orders quickly and cheaply and they also have the advantage of being able to offer omnichannel options like store pickup that Amazon cant Instead Amazon is doing what it does best offering the quickest and cheapest delivery options for online orders The company is also adding tons of products to ensure that its Prime customers continue to rely on it for everything they need It keeps improving speed which increases the chance that customers will keep using it for their everyday essentials and more and its also making efforts to cut costs Sameday orders increased 25 year over year in the third quarter and sameday deliveries are also one of its cheapest systems to operate It recently piloted a new warehouse model in Louisiana that incorporates new robotics technology Its already cutting processing time by 25 which should drive a 25 improvement in costs In five years Amazon should have even more of the ecommerce market which itself is growing generating organic growth opportunities As it gets bigger growth might slow down Amazon Web Services AWS Amazons cloud computing division accounts for 31 of the total global cloud market according to Statista Secondplace Microsoft Azure has 20 and while its lead isnt as dramatic as in ecommerce its still hefty Clients who were budgeting when inflation skyrocketed are spending again and more importantly clients who want to get in on generative AI are flocking to AWS platform Thats because Amazon has developed an incredibly powerful AI business that offers all kinds of products and features to meet almost any demand Management describes it as a threetier system with tools for developers to create their own large language models LLM its own Bedrock system for midsize enterprises to use Amazons LLMs and plugin solutions for small business clients AWS sales growth accelerated in the third quarter to 19 year over year and generative AI is already a billiondollar business However CEO Andy Jassy thinks its in its infancy and has massive longterm potential On Decembers thirdquarter earnings call he said It is a really unusually large maybe onceinalifetime type of opportunity In five years AWS should still be growing at a fast pace It also accounts for most of Amazons operating income 62 in the third quarter and it should help Amazon expand its margins Streaming isnt the first thing people usually think of when they think of Amazon because Amazon is so much more But its still competitive in streaming and it owns MGM Studios providing it with firstrate content that rivals the other big players It has the rights to Thursday Night Football and the CowboysGiants game in the third quarter was the moststreamed regular season football game ever It also has highly rated series like The Lord of the Rings The Rings of Power It recently rolled out an adsupported tier like Netflix and Walt Disney combined with a robust advertising business to generate new opportunities in the ad business In five years Amazon should be able to stay competitive adding new content beefing up the ad part and potentially making another acquisition The ad business has been Amazons fastestgrowing operation for a while Having access to Amazons hundreds of millions of Prime members who are all online to shop is a huge benefit for advertisers Amazons datarich AIbased system also gives advertisers the tools to succeed Amazon is constantly acquiring new companies while launching new products and businesses to create more sales opportunities Its investing in healthcare and its pharmacy business and its made several acquisitions over the past few years It recently acquired AI company Anthropic and I expect that its coming rollouts and acquisitions will also be focused on growing the AI business Amazon stock beat the market in 2024 and its well positioned to do it again this year Even though its already made millionaires this company still has incredible growth prospects It may not be the same as a young upstart but it also comes with less risk Amazon stock should amply reward investors over the next five years Ever feel

from SP Global Market Intelligence Like most of the Magnificent Seven Amazon had a great 2024 as investors piled into largecap technology stocks participating in the artificial intelligence AI revolution But Amazon had also entered the year with some big questions hanging over it as investors wondered whether it had fallen behind rivals in the AI race Yet over the course of the year Amazon put many of those concerns to rest Coming into 2024 some thought Amazon was caught late to the AI game After all cloud rival Microsoft invested early in OpenAI the company behind ChatGPT which appeared to give Microsoft the early lead in AI cloud workloads But did anyone think Amazon of all companies would take this lying down Since 2023 Amazon has gotten to work on its own AI cloud services First leveraging its size as the largest cloud provider heading into the AI revolution Amazon rolled out its Bedrock cloud services in mid2023 Amazon Bedrock offers a variety of competing thirdparty large language models for developers giving perhaps the most diversified AI tool portfolio of any cloud provider Additionally in late 2023 Amazon invested in OpenAI rival Anthropic which is run by OpenAIs exvice president of research Dario Amodei and is available on Bedrock Amazon then followed up that initial investment with two more investments in Anthropic in 2024 Amazons latest investment in November amounted to 4 billion bringing its total investment in Anthropic to 8 billion In conjunction with that investment Anthropic agreed to use AWS as its primary cloud provider and training partner while also committing to use Amazons Trainium and Inferentia chips to train and run its future AI models The collaboration appeared to both validate Anthropic as a key player in the AI races and a serious OpenAI competitor while also validating Amazons inhouse chips as worthy tools against the current AI training standard of expensive Nvidia GPUs But it wasnt just press releases and investments that drove Amazon higher positive financial results did too AWS revenue growth accelerated 19 in the third quarter up from 12 a year earlier And perhaps just as important the segments operating margin expanded from 303 to 381 over that same period Not to be outdone or forgotten Amazons ecommerce segment also picked up the pace and expanded margins too Amazons North America and International ecommerce empires continued their solid growth in the highsingledigits and lowdoubledigits respectively Meanwhile North America ecommerce operating margins expanded by a full percentage point from 49 to 59 while the International business expanded margins from 03 to a positive 36 margin over the past year Amazon spent the past couple of years cutting costs and transitioning to a regional delivery system in its ecommerce business and this years rapid margin expansion appears to show those efforts paying off Amazon has demonstrated resilience in the face of several bear markets and recessions over its corporate life After a difficult postpandemic slowdown the past years improvements show Amazons management culture to be as smart and resilient as its ever been even following the 2021 retirement of founder Jeff Bezos While the stock cant be considered cheap at 35 times this years earnings expectations Amazon has always appeared expensive to many as it has long prioritized longterm thinking over shortterm profits That being said the companys ability to expand profit margins this year after the rapid rise in interest rates since 2022 speaks volumes about Amazons dynamism

term Ideally a business will show two trends firstly a growing return on capital employed ROCE and secondly an increasing amount of capital employed This shows us that its a compounding machine able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns So when we looked at Amazoncom NASDAQAMZN and its trend of ROCE we really liked what we saw If you havent worked with ROCE before it measures the return pretax profit a company generates from capital employed in its business The formula for this calculation on Amazoncom is Return on Capital Employed Earnings Before Interest and Tax EBIT Total Assets Current Liabilities 014 US61b US585b US161b Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024 So Amazoncom has an ROCE of 14 In absolute terms thats a pretty normal return and its somewhat close to the Multiline Retail industry average of 12 View our latest analysis for Amazoncom Above you can see how the current ROCE for Amazoncom compares to its prior returns on capital but theres only so much you can tell from the past If youre interested you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Amazoncom The trends weve noticed at Amazoncom are quite reassuring The numbers show that in the last five years the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 14 Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that 233 more capital is being employed now too The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multibaggers and thats why were impressed In summary its great to see that Amazoncom can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multibaggers And a remarkable 135 total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future With that being said we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence Before jumping to any conclusions though we need to know what value were getting for the current share price Thats where you

Berkshire Hathaway He has the ability to spot value that others miss but most importantly he has the temperament and patience to go against the crowd Market volatility doesnt faze him because he focuses on the longterm value of the business Berkshires stock portfolio is full of strong businesses that can grow your savings over time Heres why three Motley Fool contributors believe Amazon NASDAQ AMZN TMobile US NASDAQ TMUS and Ulta Beauty NASDAQ ULTA are great buys to start 2025 John Ballard Amazon Berkshire Hathaway has held a position in Amazon since 2019 and it still held 10 million shares at the end of the third quarter of 2024 Amazons strength in several areas of its business makes it one of the best growth stocks to consider holding in 2025 and beyond Amazons online and physical stores generate less than half of the companys 620 billion in trailing12month revenue Its online store is growing sales at singledigit rates right now but managements efforts to lower costs including the use of more automation in fulfillment centers and shortening delivery distances to customers doorsteps are boosting profits In the last quarter Amazons operating profit grew 55 year over year to 174 billion Most of Amazons operating profit still comes from its fastgrowing cloud services division Amazon Web Services AWS Revenue from AWS accelerated in 2024 as demand for AI services continued to ramp up Theres a tremendous longterm opportunity in the 300 billion cloud market and Amazon is the leader Other nonretail services also continue to grow at healthy rates and fuel Amazons profit growth including advertising and thirdparty seller services However a key sign of Amazons growing appeal to consumers is the 11 yearoveryear growth in sales from subscription services last quarter which includes Prime and other entertainment offerings Amazon is clearly continuing to attract more customers to its ecosystem of services which bodes well for its position in a competitive marketplace The stock has had a nice run over the last few years but its progress in improving margins and continuing to attract corporate customers to AWS should deliver attractive returns for Amazon investors in 2025 and beyond Jeremy Bowman TMobile 2025 could be a tumultuous year on the stock market Presidentelect Donald Trump seems likely to shake up markets with tariffs and other policy changes and artificial intelligence has led to inflated valuations across the SP 500 Against that backdrop a classic Buffett strategy would be to invest in a stable cashflowing dividendpaying stock and one of the best out there right now is TMobile TMobile competes in whats essentially a triopoly with ATT and Verizon Communications in telecom The industry has high barriers to entry stable cash flows and it provides a service that wont easily be disrupted all things that Buffett looks for in a stock To boot TMobile has outperformed ATT and Verizon by avoiding the mistakes its two rivals have made and made smarter strategic decisions with spectrum As a result the stock has soared in recent years while its two biggest competitors have flatlined In its third quarter the company continued its industryleading performance with service revenue up 5 to 167 billion and postpaid service or monthly contract revenue up 8 to 133 billion It also topped the industry with postpaid net account additions of 315000 and postpaid net customer additions of 16 million TMobile continues to expand margins a benefit of growing in an industry with high fixed costs as net income jumped 43 in the quarter to 31 billion That trend should continue into 2025 as the company has more financial flexibility with less debt than ATT and Verizon making it better positioned for acquisitions and it leads the industry in 5G coverage making its network the most attractive With a dividend yield of 17 and a track record of share buybacks TMobile looks like an excellent Buffett stock to own for 2025 Jennifer Saibil Ulta Beauty Ulta is one of Buffetts newer buys and hes already sold off most of it Berkshire Hathaway first took a position in Ulta in the 2024 second quarter and it sold 96 of that position in the third quarter Ulta stock now accounts for just over 10 billion and represents a minuscule percentage of the total equity portfolio Does this mean Buffett has no confidence in Ulta He hasnt said anything about it so investors dont really know The sale implies that at present the larger stake in Ulta doesnt fit Berkshire Hathaways needs or goals But since it still held onto a piece of it I think investors can infer that he does have confidence in the company Ulta stock performed poorly in 2024 losing 11 of its value while the SP 500 gained 25 Its operating in a challenging environment and whats usually a plus for it became a minus What Im referring to is its model of offering everything a beauty enthusiast could want from mass products to luxury goods It merged the two when it developed its beauty megastores whereas previously customers could only get mass beauty products at pharmacies or similar stores and luxury merchandise at department stores In good times it attracts all kinds of customers who do all their beauty shopping under Ultas many roofs But in pressured times like the past year customers switch down from luxury brands to cheaper ones if theyre spending on extras at all Its been a rough year for Ulta In the fiscal 2024 third quarter ended Nov 2 sales crept up 17 and comparable sales increased just 06 Investors have been more concerned about the operating margin which contracted from 131 last year to 126 this year in the quarter Why can it do better in 2025 First of all it just got a new CEO Former chief operating officer Kecia Steelman is stepping into the lead role and shes a company veteran who can bring an informed view to the table As inflation moderates customers may be ready to start spending more and theyre likely to do it at their favorite beauty store And the operating margin is the lowest its been since the height of the COVID19 pandemic Any improvement or betterthanexpected performance should give the stock a boost 2025 could be a big turnaround year at Ulta but more importantly the longterm outlook is strong Its still generating higher sales and maintaining profitability opening new stores and attracting loyal fans This is an opportunity to buy it on the dip Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks Then youll want to hear this On rare occasions our expert team of analysts

underway lets take a quick look back to see the highlights and lowlights from 2024 and what could be in store for the year ahead Without a doubt one of the biggest investing themes of 2024 was artificial intelligence AI stocks Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA the king of AI stocks battled Apple in a struggle to claim the title of the worlds largest public company by market cap As of this writing Nvidia has once again surpassed the iPhone maker to claim the top spot albeit by the narrowest of margins However 2024 saw many other AI stocks surge too Palantir Technologies stock soared by a remarkable 341 SoundHound AIs stock advanced an eyepopping 836 It wasnt just the pureplay AI stocks that benefited last year Overall it was a big year for big tech Meta Platforms Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Alphabet and Apple all outperformed the SP 500 in 2024 Only Microsoft lagged the benchmark index In short thanks to the continued unfolding of the AI boom technology was a great place to invest in 2024 If there was one sector that just didnt work for investors in 2024 it was budget retailersconvenience pharmacies Walgreens Boots Alliance Dollar Tree Dollar General and CVS Health were among the worstperforming stocks in 2024 Each of them declined by at least 40 for the year with Walgreens losing more than 60 of its value The effects of inflation took a toll on all of these companies as consumers cut back on purchases As for the pharmacy retailers falling reimbursement rates for drugs increased theft and rising competition sent shares tumbling Running a close second to the budget retailers were certain healthcare stocks In particular Moderna and Biogen Moderna suffered a prolonged hangover as demand for COVID19 vaccines fell Shares of the vaccine maker tumbled by more than 57 Biogen on the other hand has various problems that contributed to its 41 selloff Sales of its key Alzheimers drug have slowed and there are concerns that the companys drug pipeline is weak meaning future revenue could come under pressure To sum up discount retailers convenience pharmacies and certain drugmakers were the big losers in 2024 As has been the case for many years I currently prefer growth stocks to value stocks In particular the tech sector remains a favorite of mine However surveying the tech landscape at the start of 2025 three stocks stand out as companies that I want to buy and hold forever Nvidia Amazon Tesla NASDAQ TSLA Nvidia makes the cut because it remains the primary beneficiary of the AI boom While Nvidias competitive advantage will eventually fade there are no signs of it happening anytime soon The company still designs the best AI chips and demand for its products remains redhot In turn the company is growing revenue and profits at a breakneck pace In short it remains all systems go for Nvidia as 2025 gets under way As for Amazon Im a longtime believer and shareholder in the company As Ive noted before Amazon is best viewed as a conglomerate rather than simply an ecommerce company Amazon Web Services AWS now generates over 100 billion in revenue per year making it a giant in its own right if it were ever spun off into its own company As for ecommerce Amazon is growing its profitability through innovations like robotics which drive down costs and shorten delivery times to consumers Finally theres Tesla Similar to Amazon I believe investors need to adjust how they think of Tesla True automotive sales still make up a huge share of the companys revenue but increasingly Tesla is becoming a robotics company As its autonomous driving software FSD improves Teslas true value could be unlocked as the company expands into ridesharing autonomous deliveries and futuristic applications we havent even considered Thats to say nothing of the companys Optimus robot which could provide another revenue stream To sum up Teslas future still looks bright as we step into 2025 making it one of my top choices as a stock to buy and hold forever Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks Then youll want to hear this On rare occasions our expert team of analysts issues a Double Down stock

tech businesses generate all the buzz from the investment community In the past theyve been able to produce tremendous returns for shareholders Two examples are Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and Apple NASDAQ AAPL successful enterprises that touch the lives of billions of people daily Despite their massive sizes they both deserve to be on your investment radar Which of these Magnificent Seven stocks is the best one to buy right now In the last 12 months Amazon reported net sales of 620 billion This is a gargantuan sum that would make you believe the top line has no upside going forward But thats a flawed assumption as Amazon benefits from numerous secular tailwinds For starters the company is the clear leader in the ecommerce market According to Statista nearly 40 of all online shopping in the US goes through Amazoncom well ahead of secondplace Walmart Ecommerce spending accounts for just 16 of total retail activity in the US so there is a long growth runway that Amazon can capture And besides streaming entertainment and digital advertising Amazon Web Services AWS is making the company a cloud computing leader commanding 31 global market share in the industry Revenue growth has accelerated in recent quarters boosted by heightened customer interest in artificial intelligence AI Recently Amazons management team led by CEO Andy Jassy has been focused on cost cuts and operational efficiency A business as large as this one unsurprisingly developed some bloat that needed addressing This is music to investors ears Thats because Amazons bottom line is expanding at a rapid clip Operating income soared 55 year over year to 174 billion in Q3 And executives believe that figure will increase 36 at the midpoint in the justended fourth quarter Wall Street analysts expect revenue to rise 11 in 2025 but they forecast operating income to just 21 I believe a continuation of this trend is in store for the foreseeable future Apple is the worlds most valuable company with a market cap of just under 37 trillion Getting to this point can be attributed to its strong brand presence one that consumers associate with a premium status highquality offerings and exceptional design and innovation This has helped the business benefit from pricing power over the years Apples hardware devices most notably the iPhone get a lot of attention Thats warranted as this single product represented 51 of company revenue in fiscal 2024 ended Sept 28 And its precisely what has made Apple a global icon But revenue growth here isnt exciting anymore Thats not the case for the companys various software and services offerings like Apple TV iCloud Apple Pay and advertising which are becoming more important for the overall business This division has grown revenue at a compound annual rate of 12 in the past three years faster than hardware And it boasts a fantastic gross margin of 74 The combination of hardware and software creates Apples powerful ecosystem This locks users in and discourages them from leaving to competitors In other words there are switching costs Another compelling trait Apple possesses is its pristine financial condition The company is incredibly profitable raking in 937 billion in net income in fiscal 2024 good for a net profit margin of 24 That has helped support a balance sheet position with 50 billion in net cash reducing financial risk for investors Theres no question these two companies are topnotch enterprises But investors cant ignore valuation as the price you pay matters As of this writing Amazon trades at a forward pricetoearnings ratio of 36 while Apples multiple is at 33 Amazons quickly expanding bottom line especially when compared to Apples more muted growth helps justify paying what is a slightly premium valuation Looking out over the next five years I believe Amazon has a chance to produce a higher return than Apple making it a better stock to buy Before you buy stock in Amazon consider this

Money starts now Im Dylan Lewis Im joined over the airwaves by Motley Fool analyst Tim Beyers Tim thanks for joining me Tim Beyers Thanks Dylan Not quite caffeinated today because its not a caffeine day but Im still ready to go Dylan Lewis Youre still bringing the energy with the caffeinefree Monday Its always a coffee morning for me Tim It might be a hot cocoa afternoon with the snow that weve gotten here in Washington DC Im very excited I am in the winter spirit but we have plenty to talk about before I can go frolic out there in the white stuff We got our first preview of some of the things that will be coming for the consumer electronics show and whats going on in the state of tech streaming this week Ahead of the trade show Comcast announced its new adbuying platform Universal Ads The company will be using its own properties in a hope to simplify the ad buying process in particular for small and medium sized businesses Tim I feel like theres already a company that does a little bit of ad buying over streaming video Tim Beyers There is You might have heard of it Its called The Trade Desk Boy I dont mean to sound cynical Dylan But does this not sound like a money grab Dylan Lewis It does Tim Beyers This totally sounds like a money grab Its not necessarily a bad thing although we dont really know too much about the details of this But heres why I say its a money grab We have a lot of different companies that are competing to be the provider of record of advertisements once theyve got your data The argument is Hey look youre here weve got your data we know best how to serve you so well be the ones that serve ads to you This has gone back a long time But probably the biggest benefactors of this shift in recent years have been Amazon built a huge advertising business because hey we know youre buying habits You should come advertise inside the Amazon platform and that has become a big business Walmart is another one that has profited from this At the same time I find it a curiosity Dylan that this has come really just like two months after The Trade Desk decided to say Hey were going to create a connected TV operating system for devices because everybody else has this selfinterested The Amazon Fire they have their own content Theyre not Switzerland here Well be Switzerland Well give you an open platform here Everybody wants a piece of this pie Dylan Is Universal Ads going to be materially better Is it going to be more simplified which is the pitch here I dont know if thats true Well I have a strong suspicion I should say that Comcast seized the margin opportunity and has decided to seize it Dylan Lewis It does feel a little bit like theyre doing the Apple thing of Hey we didnt need to be first to this but we saw how you were doing it and we like how it looks and we think we can get some margins doing it so were going to do it too I suppose if youre someone who wants to advertise and you want to advertise on their programs it doesnt really matter whether you want a Switzerlandtype relationship you are going to have to play on Universal Ads if thats the only game in town for getting onto their channel Tim Beyers Well its not clear to me that they have said its the only way to do it but it certainly feels like this is going to be the primary way and there may be some strong incentives to go through Universal Ads But its a dangerous game to make it the only avenue especially when the government has its eye on portals which has been a thing The government has been very conscious of portals and without making any political statements here one of the commonalities between the outgoing administration and the incoming administration is that both have been lets say looking somewhat askance at Big Tech They have not necessarily been buddy buddy We shouldnt presume that the next administration is going to be any more interested in giving free license to tech companies big mergers I think anytime a company decides to exert portal control you may be inviting scrutiny you dont want Dylan Lewis I think one of the interesting things is Comcast is very much seeing whats happening in Big Tech and saying wed like a piece of that and wed like to be able to have our own version of that They in the grand scheme of advertising look at a Facebook or a YouTube and say they have 10 million advertisers and we have several thousand advertisers when it comes to people who are across NBC Universal They clearly feel like they are a small player in this space even though they are maybe able to possess the relationship in a way that those other players maybe couldnt for their own content Tim Beyers To be fair we are also talking about lots of different ways One of the things thats probably going to be true about 2025 that makes this an interesting time to be trying something like Universal Ads is that we are seeing new bundles new ways of getting things I personally right now dont have access to generalized cable but I have access to Peacock and I have access to Paramount and honestly I have access to YouTube and YouTube gives me most of what I want because most things are available later on YouTube You know what Im fine with that Dylan Lewis Youre fine with waiting Tim You dont mind waiting around Tim Beyers I dont mind waiting around Dylan Lewis You mentioned Peacock and I want to get an alarm meter from you on this for The Trade Desk and for trade desk shareholders Im asking selfishly because I am one here Trade Desk was going to be one of the people selling NBC Universals Peacock I think that was announced back in 2021 They have been one of several companies that have been selling inventory there I think for the last couple of years We dont know a lot of the details of this yet but when you see this news how big of a deal do you think this is for The Trade Desk Tim Beyers I dont know how big of a deal it is for The Trade Desk but I do think the ground is shifting a little bit in terms of whos going to own the brokering relationship for putting ads out into the market That seems to be undetermined at this point Now to be fair I do think there is a big market for an independent broker that can provide good data fair pricing transparent pricing I think the market needs that I dont see them being disrupted by this but I think the desire for companies and now Comcast is another one of them do take greater control of the customer relationship and leverage that customer relationship Thats going to be something that The Trade Desk is going to have to work through dont underestimate how much of this has to do with Netflix envy I wouldnt be surprised if this is Netflix envy Dylan not at all Dylan Lewis Theyre saying you innovated in this space you created the category youve got a successful business there rolling out the ads We want a part of that We want the membership model we want the ad revenue we want it all Tim Beyers Absolutely we want a piece Dont ever underestimate envy as a motivating factor for sure Dylan Lewis Sticking with streaming Comcast is not the only one making moves this week Disney also apparently nearing a deal to bring Hulu Live TV together with Fubo This is a smaller streamer that is known for its sports content The focus on sports here maybe not necessarily a surprise because Disney has been developing venue sports with Fox and Warner Brothers and Fubo has been a thorn in their side as theyve been trying to do that too Tim Beyers In fact they sued over it A judge had actually blocked the launch of a venue Fubo did was starting to get some traction here from that lawsuit This is according to the Wall Street Journal that the judge said that the deal this new bundle would substantially lessen competition and restrain trade Not great The partners in Venue which are essentially the partners in Hulu and the Hulu Live TV service have appealed the decision but now it does look like by virtue of an acquisition or a merger I guess it would be in this case you can make that litigation go away It is interesting This is what I said previously We are talking about different types of very specialized bundles showing up Streaming it makes your ability to make a bundle that fits you a little more compelling Like I said in this case my bundle is YouTube free I pay for it with ads and then cheap Peacock and Paramount I get a fair amount of sports ball which I want and I get some decent TV programming and I get plenty of movies Im good The only other one Ive added to that is Netflix I added that recently Thats a very tailored bundle You can see Dylan that this is going to be a thing where you have specialized bundles coming together to serve a particular niche In this case its sports But it might be something entirely different It may be a reality TV bundle or cooking shows bundle I fully expect that that comes around At some point this is just the precursor To be clear about whats happening here this feels more than anything else like look we just want to move forward with our sports bundle Can we get the litigation to stop I think thats what this is Dylan Lewis Fubo TV I think before this deal was announced was a subbillion dollar company I could see Disney basically saying I think we can pay to make this go away for about 15 billion I think thats within our wheelhouse The venue sports bundle that they are developing with Fox and Warner Brothers focused on sports No surprise there its right there in the name Live games and event coverage from the major professional sports leagues and major college conferences sounds very appealing I think whats fascinating about this is Disney just spent so much time trying to untangle the multiowned joint venture that is Hulu Then theyre are saying lets hop right back into that lane with venue sports Tim What do you make of that Tim Beyers Irony never disappoints Number 1 never ever does it disappoint Thats Number 1 But Number 2 is it tells you something about the appeal of targeted bundling Thats what I mean When I said that I think we can expect to see more targeted bundling I think Disney has woken up to realize that it might be a bit of an ask for some people to say you can get the whole big enchilada If you want live TV in that Hulu bundle its still not that cheap Youre still not that far off 100 if you want live TV in a bundle I dont know that that is a sale that works anymore In the era of YouTube and very targeted streaming Im not sure Im the only one whos like I dont know that I need that It just went YouTube my very targeted streaming services Figuring out how to maybe make these things a little bit more appetizing I think is the thing One of the ways to do it is to control a niche and then package the niche Well see but its a very interesting time Dylan Lewis Putting the story here with Fubo and Disney together with that Universal Ads story I do see a little bit of a throughline in that it seems like it is going to get impossible almost for smaller players to really establish themselves in streaming The Trade Desks of the world they were able to seize a market opportunity because the legacy players hadnt quite gotten there yet Fubo was one of those smaller players that people have thought maybe might be able to turn into something I dont know how easy its going to be for anyone over the next five or ten years that is not already a major media brand to hop into this space whether its on the ad side or on the content side Tim Beyers Thats a really good point and its hard to see to maybe validate your point a bit here the great cautionary tale in this space is CuriosityStream which is now the MicroWest of microcaps Dylan Lewis Its 100 million I think Tim Beyers It just hasnt really gone anywhere For those who dont know the ticker CURI is a microcap streamer of documentaries Its not like thats a bad service or something that is unwanted There are people who are very much in the market for yes I want to see a bunch of documentaries but how you make that into something big is its just harder to see To your point youre probably going to have the major media companies But what those major media companies are doing is a different strategy to profit which may be like creating some balkanized very specialized content bundles and maybe not trying to make you swallow 100 to 200 a month but trying to get you on a consistent 35 a month Does that actually work I dont know but that favors the companies that already have a chokehold on content and licensing deals Dylan Lewis Tim you know what one of my favorite bundles is Tim Beyers Tell me Dylan Lewis You and Monday Motley Fool Money Thanks for joining me today Tim Beyers Nice Well done Thank you Thanks Dylan MUSIC Dylan Lewis Listeners coming up on the show Youve probably heard about the sports betting platform DraftKings But what about the company that powers DraftKings and a number of other sports betting platforms around the world Up next Anand Chokkavelu host Dan Caplinger and Dave Meier for a Scoreboard episode Breaking Down Sportradar MUSIC Anand Chokkavelu Welcome to latest Motley Fool Scoreboard Im Anand Chokkavelu Weve got longtime Fools Dan Caplinger and David Meier giving a 110 rating to sports gambling data provider Sportradar ticker symbol SRAD First well hit the business including factors like industry and competition A ten is invincible a one is hopeless Davids going with an eight Dans going with a seven David I know youre pretty hot on this stock why dont you tell us about the business David Meier Sure Sportradar licenses sports data from leagues and sports literally all around the world What it does is it takes that data and turns it into a variety of different content and betting opportunities that it sells to its customers whether its a Draft Kings on the betting side or a CBS sports on the content side The company has proven itself to be both a smart buyer of the data and a smart seller of its products and for that reason I think its a very good business model Dan Caplinger I gave it a seven I like the business model as well Davids right Theres a whole lot of betting services out there across the world Plenty of competition in that space in a highly competitive market I love to look at the pick and shovel places the underlying businesses that make these industries go These betting sites cant do what they do without the data to back them up Thats what Sportradar is giving them I like it I gave them a seven Anand Chokkavelu Give the apps the data I take that data on the apps I convert it into losses You might want to invest in me laughs Lets go on to management A 10 is Warren Buffett a one is Homer Simpson David gives an eight Dan gives a seven This time well go with Dan Dan Caplinger Ive got a lot of confidence in founder CEO Carsten Koerl We like to see founders who are invested in their businesses Koerl is 23yearveteran in the business and prior to that he worked at an actual betting site and so he understands what his betting site customers need from Sportradar I think that helps to inform his leadership style has done well operationally as well as from a stock performance standpoint David Meier As you said on it I gave it an eight and I completely agree Carsten Koerl has been a great founder CEO Interestingly he reorganized the company in early 2024 in order to simplify the business structure In the process in my opinion he hired a very key new executive whose name is Behshad Behzadi Behshad is now the chief technical officer and chief AI officer Basically what theyre doing is bringing their technology platform and their analytics platform into the modern era Ive been impressed so far and I look forward to seeing what they do with the business going forward Anand Chokkavelu For financials a 10 is a fortress a one is yikes Davids going with an eight Dans a bit lower at a six Start with the bull case here David David Meier laughs It was a little rough actually in 2023 but growth has returned and thats on the back of extending and expanding its deal with the NBA and a number of other sports leagues around the world I expect to see additional scale going forward as this growth persists You got to remember the way this works is they pay money upfront to get the licensing deals and over time they monetize it Thats how we should see the scale from the new deals Anand Chokkavelu I dont think I disagree with anything David said I think I just ding Sportradar a little bit for that rough patch that hes talking about Theyve shown nice revenue growth Theres modest profitability I like the fact that the balance sheets relatively strong minimal debt significant amounts of cash available to inform strategic decisions or reinvestments in the business Its just I like to see more consistent The fact that you go through a rough patch I think is probably the reason why our scores differ on that score Real quick David before we go on evaluation I have a follow up question which is why do the apps need Sportradar as a middle person between the leagues and the apps David Meier Ill use DraftKings as an example again What is DraftKings core competency Its marketing Theyre not in the analytics business in terms of how do I interface with the sporting data Thats what Sportradar is good at and so its better for a company like DraftKings and many others to go to Sportradar to get the betting opportunity and present it to its customers Anand Chokkavelu Beautiful Lets move on to valuation Dan well start with you How well will Sportradar stock do over the next five years How safe is it Ten is a sure thing one is a lottery ticket Dan Caplinger I put five year returns of five to 10 Some might think that thats low Thats actually pretty much middle of the road for me I like the stock is starting to gain some momentum here New legalizations at the state level for online gambling in the US I think is helping the industry overall Questions whether that expansion will continue I give them a safety score of six just because I think theres some question about that future direction and the extent of future growth that we havent already seen priced into the stock David Meier Im agreeing with Dan on the safety score I also gave it a six As you noted earlier I am a bull I think theres 15 plus returns available even after the recent rise in the stock One of the reasons is this is the industry leader and they are a trusted partner Theyve been able to renew their contracts at higher and higher levels for a number of years The paradox here is actually the United States is the emerging market here Dan pointed to legalization within different US states That is absolutely a growth Those are the growth opportunities going forward Theres definitely risk though You can pay too much for the data You could price your bets and your contents poorly I also think theres risk but I think the return potential is very much worth it Anand Chokkavelu Everyones favorite topic Dan is there accompanying Sportradar space you like more It depends how you want to define the space Im not really sure theres any other company that does sports data the way the Sportradar does When you broaden it out to the betting world more broadly Id go with MGM Resorts ticker MGM Its a betting site provider It might be a potential customer Sportradar they also have the Brick and Mortar Casino resorts You have a good loyalty program The loyalty has branched out to talk with other loyalty programs like the Marriott Bonvoy program Its got exposure to the Asian gaming capital of Macau I think its an interesting play right now David Meier The direct competitor is a company called Genius Sports ticker is GENI I agree with Dan you got to broaden out a little bit One company I think thats very interesting is a maker and licenser of digital casino games I learned about this company from our colleague Bill Mann and the company is called Evolution AB Its a little tough to trade on because its on the pink sheets but that is a very interesting company Anand Chokkavelu You like it more than Sportradar David David Meier Yes but its hard to buy Anand Chokkavelu Thats what makes it all so worthwhile right David Meier Yeah Anand Chokkavelu laughs Thank you to David and Dan Theyve given Sportradar pretty good overall score of 71 out of 10 short of that 80 that would force me to own shares Left to his own devices though David would have given it an eight if you average all his scores Its one Ive been meaning to look at actually because David got it on my radar a few months ago Maybe youll look into it as well Dylan Lewis Listeners

Sign in to access your portfolio","Tip Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy Sell or Hold decision about a stock While media reports about rating changes by these brokeragefirm employed or sellside analysts often affect a stocks price do they really matter Lets take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Amazon AMZN before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage Amazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation ABR of 110 on a scale of 1 to 5 Strong Buy to Strong Sell calculated based on the actual recommendations Buy Hold Sell etc made by 50 brokerage firms An ABR of 110 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy Of the 50 recommendations that derive the current ABR 46 are Strong Buy and three are Buy Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 92 and 6 of all recommendations Check price target stock forecast for Amazon here While the ABR calls for buying Amazon it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential Do you wonder why As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias According to our research brokerage firms assign five Strong Buy recommendations for every Strong Sell recommendation In other words their interests arent always aligned with retail investors rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading Therefore the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stocks price movement Zacks Rank our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record categorizes stocks into five groups ranging from Zacks Rank 1 Strong Buy to Zacks Rank 5 Strong Sell and is an effective indicator of a stocks price performance in the near future Therefore using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5 they are two completely different measures The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals example 128 In contrast the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions It is displayed in whole numbers 1 to 5 It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations Because of their employers vested interests these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support misguiding investors far more often than helping them In contrast the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions And nearterm stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions according to empirical research Furthermore the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year In other words at all times this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness When you look at the ABR it may not be uptodate Nonetheless since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough it is always timely in predicting future stock prices In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Amazon the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 16 over the past month to 528 Analysts growing optimism over the companys earnings prospects as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates has resulted in a Zacks Rank 1 Strong Buy for Amazon You can see the complete list of todays Zacks Rank 1 Strong Buy stocks here Therefore the Buyequivalent ABR for Amazon may serve as a useful guide for investors

course one figure often stands out among the rest earnings The earnings figure itself is key but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as if not more important Therefore investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher The Zacks Earnings ESP or Expected Surprise Prediction aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications Amazon AMZN earns a Zacks Rank 1 27 days from its next quarterly earnings release on February 6 2025 and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at 174 a share By taking the percentage difference between the 174 Most Accurate Estimate and the 153 Zacks Consensus Estimate Amazon

industrial real estate in the United States but also the largest real estate investment trust or REIT of any kind While the business itself is performing quite well there are some fears regarding the state of industrial real estate as well as the interest rate environment and these have caused the stock to fall by more than 20 from its 52week high Heres a rundown of how Prologis business is doing why the stock is down and why it could be a good idea to take a closer look at this fantastic company right now Prologis is a massive REIT that specializes in logistics properties such as warehouses and distribution centers If youve ever seen one of those massive Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN fulfilment centers thats the type of property Im referring to In fact Amazon is Prologis largest tenant by a wide margin As of the latest quarter Prologis owns more than 12 billion square feet of rentable space located on four continents around the world It leases space to 6700 different customers with top tenants in addition to Amazon including Home Depot NYSE HD FedEx NYSE FDX and UPS NYSE UPS Just to put this scale into perspective 27 trillion worth of goods moves through Prologis properties every year representing nearly 3 of the worlds GDP This is a big real estate business There are a few valid reasons Prologis is down more than most other REITs For one thing there are some concerns that overbuilding during the COVID19 pandemic combined with economic worries will lead to falling occupancy And to be sure Prologis occupancy has fallen from 977 to 959 over the past two years and its retention rate is 70 basis points lower To be sure this feels like more of a normalization after an excellent few years but it is definitely worth watching More importantly the persistent highinterest rate environment has put pressure on commercial real estate values I wont get too deep into the details but capitalization rates cap rates are a solid indicator of property values Lower cap rates mean higher property values relative to rental income In a nutshell think of a cap rate as the propertys net rental income as a percentage of its market value Since 2021 industrial real estate cap rates have increased from 41 to about 54 and the general idea is that this means industrial property values are down by about 25 Despite the legitimate concerns and headwinds there are some good reasons why Prologis could be a great stock to buy right now Just to name a few Ecommerce demand continues to rise Only about 225 of retail sales are ecommerce in Prologis markets This percentage has been steadily growing for the past two decades and is expected to reach nearly 30 by 2028 Ecommerce needs three times as much warehouse space than brickandmortar retail Prologis has been quietly getting into the data center real estate business and is targeting 78 billion in development spending by 2028 This could allow the company to be a big beneficiary of the AI investment boom Prologis has a great track record of creating shareholder value through development estimated at 136 billion so far It sees the potential for over 40 billion in future development which could be a big growth driver going forward While interest rate cuts are likely to be slower than initially expected in 2025 the overwhelming consensus is that the direction of interest rates will be lower for the next several years This not only means lower borrowing costs but should also help lower cap rates and therefore make industrial properties more valuable Prologis has lots of embedded rent growth in its portfolio In simple terms industrial property rent surged during the COVID19 pandemic but many of the companys leases were initiated before it started As the older leases expire well see rental income increase In fact Prologis estimates that market rates are about 35 more than it is currently receiving from its properties on average Finally Prologis trades for a significant discount to its historical pricetoFFO funds from operations valuation While there could certainly be shortterm headwinds in the real estate space Prologis is an extremely solid business and it looks like an excellent time for

the concomitant need to invest in data centers to support that growth Ill get to Vistras role in a moment first a few words on how nuclear power became popular in 2024 There is a critical need to secure a longterm reliable power source for data centers and nuclear power is increasingly seen as the answer Nuclear power is seen as a carbonfree way to ensure reliable power and it has become even more popular considering renewable energys difficulties in recent years including surging costs logistics issues and supply chain constraints Indeed its no coincidence that the most significant three cloud service providers signed deals with nuclear power producers in 2024 Microsoft inked a longterm power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy to restart part of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant Alphabets Google signed a deal to buy nuclear energy from small modular reactors SMR developed by Kairos Power Meanwhile Amazons Amazon Web Services paid 650 million to buy a data center campus from Talen Energy and signed a longterm deal to buy power from Talens nearby nuclear plant Amazon also signed deals to support the development of SMRs While the AmazonTalen deal received a blow when the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected a proposal allowing Talen to sell more power to Amazon the IT giant has subsequently reaffirmed its commitment to the original equipment The company started the year with only 2400 megawatts MW of its 36702 MW of generating capacity coming from nuclear but significantly added to that figure with the completion of a deal to acquire Energy Harbor in March adding 4000 MW of nuclear generation capacity Vistra would then acquire the remaining 15 it didnt own in Vistra Vision which held its nuclear assets among others The deal was perfect

exploration development and production of natural gas CTRA is currently 1 Ranked Trading at a little over 27 per share and 970X forward earnings CTRA has a Value Score of B The company trades 70 below its fiveyear high of 3275X and is under the median of 988X Coterra Energy has more than doubled over the last five years to beat the SP 500s increase of 101 But the stock has just managed a meager 44 gain over the last six months underperforming the benchmark during the period In other words Coterra Energy shares appear to be oversold at the moment considering its strong fundamentals and valuation

specific company name for relevant results The best way to generate wealth is to invest while keeping the years and decades ahead in mind Businesses that are successful have likely spent years innovating and evolving That describes Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA well as it originally developed leading central processing unit CPU computer chips used in gaming and eventually cryptocurrency mining applications Now its the leading supplier for artificial intelligence AI applications Nvidia has been all the rage among market watches recently but the company has been around for over 30 years Its been publicly traded since early 1999 CEO Jensen Huang was among the founders who initially aimed to develop graphics chips for personal computers Its CUDA compute unified device architecture software platform was launched almost 20 years ago and it is now an important part of the investment case The focus in its early years was on performance improvements in 3D graphics used in the gaming industry But the stock performance lagged until the early 2020s when revenue began to grow from the Nvidia RTX platform that uses AI to create realistic graphics and visual effects for gaming 3D design and other uses Huangs keynote speech at the recent CES conference was used to introduce the RTX 50series chips that use Nvidias Blackwell graphics processing unit GPU architecture in the companys AI accelerators That circle of innovation is what investors need to keep in mind to see what Nvidia can do in the coming decade And Huang gave everyone a brief introduction to whats coming in that CES keynote address Nvidias recent stock returns have been nothing short of phenomenal As AI drives the need for more computing power quarterly revenue increased by over 1000 since 2020 Much of that came in the last two years as large tech companies spent heavily to build out data centers needed for AI applications Those companies are still investing to boost compute power Microsoft President Brad Smith recently said his company expects to invest 80 billion in its fiscal 2025 for AIenabled data centers used to train models Smith commented None of this progress would be possible without new partnerships founded on largescale infrastructure investments that serve as the essential foundation of AI innovation and use Amazon also recently announced it has plans to spend about 11 billion to expand its presence in Georgia to support Amazon Web Services AWS cloud computing and AI technologies Nvidia is arguably the biggest beneficiary of this spending and investors have poured into the stock driving shares over 2000 higher since 2020 Nvidias data center segment dominated its revenue path recently but gaming revenue is still growing and represented a meaningful 94 of total revenue in the recent quarter Huang sees another avenue for growth coming Nvidias secondfastestgrowing segment in the most recent quarter was automotive and robotics with a 72 yearoveryear revenue increase In his CES conference speech Huang spoke a lot about robots and selfdriving cars two realworld applications made possible by AI Huang sees the robotics era coming soon and grouped both humanoid robots and selfdriving cars in that category He said it could be the largest technology industry the world has ever seen Nvidias robot operating system ROS Isaac utilizes its CUDAaccelerated software packages and AI models to develop advanced AI robotics applications He also announced Nvidias nextgeneration processor for autonomous cars called Thor Thor processes the massive amount of sensor information from cameras radar and lidar light detection and ranging being used on vehicles Using Nvidias latest CPU and GPU advances including Blackwell architecture Huang said Thor has 20 times the processing capability of the previous generation chip which is the standard today The Thor processor is also used for humanoid robots Huang described it as a universal robotics computer One can see how each of Nvidias segments and innovations is interconnected And thats precisely why Nvidia stock could still be the best investment of the next decade Huang said he expects surprisingly rapid breakthroughs in general robotics in the next several years And Nvidia supplies all the enabling technologies As if it needs another growth segment Huang also introduced an AI desktop computer at CES that incorporates Blackwell He said Placing an AI supercomputer on the desks of every data scientist AI researcher and student empowers them to engage and shape the age of AI That desktop supercomputer will be available in May for a price of 3000 Its another example of the companys innovative approach that pushes the boundaries of technology Nvidia has many ongoing projects and somehow seems to connect them all It should be a core holding in any growth stock portfolio for the next decade Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks Then youll want to hear

Investment of the Decade was originally published by The Motley Fool According to the average brokerage recommendation ABR one should invest in Nvidia NVDA It is debatable whether this highly soughtafter metric is effective because Wall Street analysts recommendations tend to be overly optimistic Would it be worth investing in the stock The artificial intelligence AI trend has given big boosts to the share prices of Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing NYSE TSM over the past year The massive demand for powerful chips capable of handling AI workloads in data centers has played a central role in driving those share price gains with major cloud service companies and governments deploying large quantities of the AIspecific semiconductors designed by Nvidia

US economy has a remarkable track record of producing the worlds most valuable companies United States Steel became the first 1 billion company in 1901 General Motors rode the automotive boom to become the firstever 10 billion company in 1955 General Electric which manufactures refrigerators and airplane engines among many other things became the worlds first 100 billion company in 1995 Apple hit the most significant milestone to date when its valuation crossed 1 trillion for the first time in 2018 thanks to the success of devices like the iPhone Apple is still the worlds largest company with a market capitalization of 37 trillion But since 2018 seven other American technology companies have joined it in the trilliondollar club Microsoft Nvidia Amazon Alphabet Meta Platforms Tesla and Broadcom I think one more company is set to earn its membership in this club within the next four years Some of the biggest artificial intelligence AI developers in the world are lining up to rent Oracles NYSE ORCL industryleading data center infrastructure and this part of its business could grow more than tenfold according to managements guidance Oracles market cap is 463 billion as of this writing so if it does join the 1 trillion club in four years as I predict investors who buy its stock today could earn a very nice return of 116 Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts data center operators like Oracle Microsoft and Amazon will spend 1 trillion over the next four years on upgrading their infrastructure to meet demand from AI developers That involves filling them with thousands of graphics processors GPUs which are specialized chips designed to ingest and process mountains of data for AI workloads Nvidia supplies the most powerful GPUs in the industry And Oracles Cloud Infrastructure OCI supercluster technology enables developers to scale up to 65000 of Nvidias H200 GPUs which is the highest number in the industry To put it simply access to more chips can enable developers to build and deploy larger models which translates into smarter AI software OCIs random direct memory access RDMA technology also allows data to flow from one point to another much faster than traditional Ethernet networks And since most developers rent computing capacity by the minute faster processing can equal major cost savings During its recent fiscal 2025 second quarter ended Oct 31 Oracle said GPU use climbed by 336 compared to the same period in fiscal 2024 which speaks to how quickly demand is ramping up So far OCIs infrastructure has attracted top AI startups like Cohere OpenAI and Elon Musks xAI Oracle currently operates 98 data center regions and plans to grow that footprint by more than tenfold to somewhere between 1000 and 2000 locations over time The companys OCI will soon offer new clusters featuring over 131000 of Nvidias latest Blackwell GPUs which will pave the way for the most advanced AI applications yet and potentially drive a new wave of demand Oracle generated 141 billion in total revenue during the second quarter but the OCI segment was responsible for just 24 billion of that total so it isnt a massive contributor yet Its still smaller than Oracles softwareasaservice SaaS business which generated 35 billion in revenue during the quarter It offers readymade cloud applications to help businesses across dozens of industries manage everything from their inventory to their payroll However OCI is consistently the star performer when it comes to growth While SaaS revenue grew by 10 year over year during the second quarter OCI revenue soared by 52 It was the fastest growth in a year and it marked the second consecutive quarter of acceleration OCI revenue would have grown even faster if Oracle had more data center capacity available but its still struggling to meet demand even though its building infrastructure as quickly as possible That demand can be seen in Oracles remaining performance obligations RPOs which soared by 50 during the second quarter to 97 billion RPOs typically convert into revenue at a future date once the company can deliver the agreedupon services ie OCI revenue could surge once it can bring more data centers on line based on the deals it has already locked in Oracle CEO Safra Catz predicts RPOs will grow even higher from here because of the sheer volume of deals the company is signing including a major one with Meta Platforms recently Meta developed the worlds most popular opensource large language models LLMs called Llama which have been downloaded over 600 million times and the company will shift some of its training workloads over to Oracles infrastructure Oracle stock trades at a pricetoearnings ratio PE of 405 which is a slight premium to the average PE of Microsoft Amazon and Alphabet 367 They are three of the biggest operators of AI data center infrastructure besides Oracle But Oracle stock looks much more attractive when we measure its value based on its potential earnings For example Wall Streets consensus estimate provided by Yahoo suggests the companys earnings per share EPS will grow by 144 to 705 during its fiscal year 2026 which starts in June of this calendar year That places its stock at a forward PE of just 235 Mathematically speaking Oracle stock would have to soar by 723 over the next 18 months just to maintain its current PE of 405 which would value the company at almost 800 billion If it grows its EPS by 144 again in fiscal 2027 and fiscal 2028 while maintaining the same PE it will be a 104 trillion company Even if its PE settles at 367 its valuation would still be around 950 billion But Oracles earnings actually grew by 22 in the first half of fiscal 2025 and I think that pace is likely to persist and maybe even accelerate suggesting Wall Street might be too conservative Remember The company plans to grow its data center footprint more than tenfold And its infrastructure is unique because its fully automated meaning it should become significantly more profitable at scale In fact during the last couple of quarterly conference calls with investors Catz talked about how the gross profit margin of the infrastructure business is climbing as more data centers come on line If Oracle grows its earnings by 22 annually instead of 14 through fiscal 2028 it will be a shooin to join the 1 trillion club even if its PE drops to around 34 Before you buy stock in Oracle consider this The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now

2024 marking the first time the index posted backtoback years of 20 gains or higher since the 1990s There are 11 stock market sectors but only three beat the SP 500 last year communications financials and consumer discretionary Even the technology sector underperformed the SP 500 last year In fact only 148 SP 500 components beat the index last year meaning over 70 of components underperformed the index Heres why these three standout sectors did well last year how they can carry the momentum forward this year and lowcost exchangetraded funds ETFs you can use to invest in each sector Communications was the bestperforming sector last year producing a 348 total return capital gains plus dividends The sector was led by its three highestweighted components Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Meta Platforms NASDAQ META and Netflix NASDAQ NFLX which rose 355 654 and 831 respectively in 2024 Besides social media and streaming companies the sector has traditional media giants like Comcast and Walt Disney telecom companies and more Despite running up in 2023 and 2024 the sector remains a good value going into 2025 Legacy media companies and telecom titans tend to pay dividends and feature inexpensive valuations Even Alphabet and Meta have reasonable valuations because they generate tons of free cash flow and solid earnings growth The sector depends heavily on advertising and consumer spending So a downturn in those categories could result in slowing growth and even a sectorwide selloff But the longterm outlook for the sector is encouraging especially given Metas success with monetizing Instagram and Netflixs expanding margins and pricing power Vanguard offers lowcost sectorbased ETFs with 01 expense ratios The Vanguard Communications ETF NYSEMKT VOX mirrors the sectors performance making it a simple yet effective tool for investing in stocks like Alphabet and Meta The financial sector was a standout winner in 2024 The sector includes Berkshire Hathaway big banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley regional banks payment processors like Visa Mastercard and American Express insurance companies and more The sector has done well amid relatively higher interest rates Banks can see expanded net interest margins during periods of higher rates because the difference between the rates they collect on lending like mortgages and car loans and what they pay on deposits and savings accounts widens But higher interest rates can also slow economic growth Last year stood out because economic growth was solid despite higher rates Integrated banks and investment banks thrived with many of those companies seeing record profits and stock prices Payment processors like Visa had slowing growth but were remarkably resilient thanks to network effects that led to moderate earnings growth despite pressured consumer spending The financials sector has run up a considerable amount so it isnt as compelling a value as it used to be But relative to the SP 500 it is still a decent value The Vanguard Financials ETF NYSEMKT VFH features a 171 pricetoearnings ratio PE and a 16 dividend yield compared to a 271 PE and a 12 yield for the Vanguard SP 500 ETF NYSEMKT VOO Economic slowdowns can affect the sector making it cyclical So investors should be aware of the potential volatility before diving headfirst into the Vanguard Financials ETF The consumer discretionary sector had a slow start to the year but a secondhalf rally by Tesla NASDAQ TSLA and a new record high for Amazon NASDAQ AMZN helped polevault it to a 266 total return in 2024 It contains industries you may have thought were in a different sector For example carmakers like Tesla and legacy automakers fall under the consumer discretionary sector although theres a case to be made that Tesla is more of a technology company and automakers like Ford Motor Company and General Motors are industrial Similarly Amazon and MercadoLibre are techfocused companies in the consumer discretionary sector The sector holds many familiar names like McDonalds Starbucks and Nike Like the other sector ETFs on this list the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF NYSEMKT VCR is fairly topheavy with a combined 457 weighting in Amazon Tesla Home Depot and Lowes Companies Beyond that the fund achieves solid diversification with 298 components It can be highly cyclical Slowdowns in consumer spending can affect home improvement budgets and lead to pullbacks on categories like expensive vacations or dining out Runups in Amazon and Telsa have made the sector more expensive with a PE ratio around the SP 500 average and a yield of just 07 But it can continue producing marketbeating gains if the economy grows reasonably and consumers open up their pocketbooks on discretionary goods and services The communications financials and consumer discretionary sectors include completely different industries But all three sectors can be cyclical and vulnerable to ebbs and flows in the business cycle By knowing the leading components in each sector you can know what to expect from each one based on how different companies perform For example it would be very challenging for the communications sector to beat the SP 500 if there were a major selloff in Alphabet and Meta Similarly Amazon and Tesla could drag down the

We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Technology Stocks to Invest In for the Long Term In this article we are going to take a look at where Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN stands against the other technology stocks On January 1 King Lip BakerAvenue Wealth Managements chief strategist and partner joined CNBCs Closing Bell to discuss market outlooks as we enter 2025 His focus was on the impressive performance of tech stocks in 2024 with expectations for a second consecutive year of doubledigit gains Lip was against the prevailing sentiment among investors that big tech has peaked and that funds should rotate into smaller stocks or other themes He argued that the recent weakness in the tech sector is largely due to technical rebalancing rather than a fundamental downturn He emphasized that cash is likely to flow back into leading tech stocks as they are projected to deliver the highest earnings growth in 2025 with an anticipated earnings increase of over 20 Discussing high valuations in the tech sector particularly for largecap stocks trading at forward earnings multiples between 32 and 35 times Lip countered that many valuations remain within one standard deviation of their historical norms over the past decade He pointed out that the MAG7 have consistently provided strong returns and are wellpositioned for future growth Lip identified Broadcom as a top stock praising its management under Hock Tan and its unique role in the market as a provider of custom AI chips He noted that the company operates at a lower earnings multiple while benefiting from substantial growth Lip also discussed Palantir which has garnered attention for its profitability and positive cash flow since becoming profitable two years ago despite its high valuation exceeding 50 times revenue he believes it is wellpositioned to benefit from government spending cuts and AI initiatives While acknowledging concerns about insider selling and high valuations for the company Lip remains optimistic about its future potential suggesting it could be more appealing if it drops to the mid60 range Lip is bullish on tech stocks in 2025 that will be driven by strong earnings growth and ongoing investments in AI infrastructure The NASDAQ 100 index has performed remarkably well achieving a return of 27 in 2024 following a staggering 538 return in 2023 This reflects

American ecommerce company could generate an 18 CAGR in its stock price over the next 10 years and that its current stock price offers over a 30 margin of safety for investment Although there are risks with net income margin volatility I am confident that managements background in investment banking will lead shareholders to longterm prosperity and high annual returns for decades to come Warning GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with MELI MercadoLibre is the most popular ecommerce website in Latin America commanding a 35 market share in Brazil significantly outpacing Amazon NASDAQAMZN which holds just 163 in Brazil one of the regions largest markets With approximately 322 million monthly visits it nearly doubles Amazon Brazils traffic and has almost 50 times the traffic of Amazons Spanishlanguage pages Additionally because MercadoLibre operates in 18 countries in Latin America it has unparalleled regional coverage The company operates several other divisions within its main ecommerce operations such as logistics but one area that deserves specific attention in my opinion is Mercado Pago the companys fintech arm Nearly 26 of the Latin American population remained unbanked in 2021 so MercadoLibre has developed a digital wallet that users can deposit cash into at partner locations This opens the company up to a previously unaddressable demographic of customers and shows ingenuity and sensitivity to Latin American economics As of the latest quarter MercadoLibre achieved a 35 yearoveryear revenue growth rate an 11 yearoveryear net income growth rate and a 35 yearoveryear growth rate in Mercado Pagos monthly active users The company also opened six new fulfillment centers five in Brazil and one in Mexicoa move that will benefit customer satisfaction through improved delivery speeds in the long run but may pressure the companys margins in the near term I mentioned Amazon previously but there are other competitors that deserve to be addressed For example Walmart NYSEWMT is leveraging its physical retail presence to strengthen its ecommerce operations in the region by bringing its Bodega Aurrera discount store chain online in Mexico There are also regional players like Magazine Luiza Magalu which reported hundreds of percentage points of growth in ecommerce revenues during the pandemic and Falabella which has a strong presence in Chile Peru and Colombia Moreover there is the entry of Chinese ecommerce giants into the Latin American ecommerce arena Shein an ultrafast fashion retailer has quickly gained traction in Latin America with sales growing by over 800 since its entrance into the region in 2019 Temu and AliExpress are also targeting pricesensitive consumers in the region However MercadoLibre stands out due to its broad infrastructure and integrated ecosystem Operationally and financially Im highly bullish on MercadoLibre The management team is also robust with CEO Chairman and CoFounder Marcos Galperin being at the helm for over 25 years and previously working at JP Morgan JPM The CFO Martin de los Santos previously worked at Goldman Sachs GS Moreover Osvaldo Gimenez the President of Fintech has been with the company for more than 20 years and previously worked at Booz Allen Hamilton BAH and Santander SAN With such experience and length of tenure showing commitment to the company I think the businessand my capital if I decide to investis in relatively safe hands Because I consider MercadoLibre to be an excellent longterm investment my valuation model comprises a horizon of 10 years I anticipate that the company will be able to grow its revenues at a 14 CAGR over the next decade Starting with December 2024 annual revenue of 2075 billion my forecast arrives at 7692 billion in annual revenue by December 2034 This accounts for an expanding and maintained market position but also considers market maturity and competitive constraints The companys net margin has not been stable but I am optimistic that this will stabilize in 10 years time To be conservative I use a terminal net margin of 175 which accounts for fintech expansion higher operational efficiencies related to automation but also acknowledges the investments the company will need to make to maintain its market share amid increasing competition including potentially more aggressive tactics from Amazon if its focus becomes less acute on AI by 2034 The result of my analysis is a December 2034 net income estimate of 1346 billion MercadoLibres share count has been increasing at a CAGR of 138 over the past 10 years If this trend continues the company will have total shares outstanding of 5855 million Therefore my estimate for the companys earnings per share in December 2034 is 22989 Due to an expanding net margin MercadoLibres PE ratio is likely to contract significantly by December 2034 Its current PE ratio is 60 and the sector median is 20 I will be using the midpoint of these two figures 40 for my terminal multiple The result is a December 2034 price target for MercadoLibre stock of 9200 This indicates a CAGR of 182 over the period from the present stock price of 1730 MercadoLibres weighted average cost of capital is 1374 with an equity weight of 9411 and a debt weight of 589 The cost of equity is 1429 and the cost of debt after tax is 492 When discounting back my estimate for MercadoLibres December 2034 price target to the present day using the weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate the implied intrinsic value is 2540 Therefore the margin of safety for investment implied by my model is 32 While I find it unlikely the company could encounter several difficulties which destabilize its net income What is more likely is that by December 2034 the net income margin will be below 15 due to aggressive pricing by competitors bad debt provisions from its credit operations and rising logistics investments This is where managements investment banking experience will be valuable in driving longterm shareholder value through a consistent cost structure and investment program focusing on retaining margins rather than becoming a company that exhibits profitability cycles which is unattractive to most investors in the ecommerce industry Im considering buying a stake in MercadoLibre due to its robust market position in Latin America and its nuanced understanding of the culture and customs As my valuation model indicates an 18 CAGR in its stock price over the next 10 years and a 32 margin of safety the investment appears a prudent addition to the growth side of a conservative longterm portfolio I expect much stronger returns from MercadoLibre stock than Amazon over the next decade due to both valuation and the relative size of the companies This article first

mandates have set the tone for 2025 with big companies like WPP BT and Amazon turning a new leaf on mandatory office presence as the year kicks off As large corporations try to pivot to working more from the office theyve invariably encountered the same problems pushback from employees and the lack of office space Another issue as highlighted in Amazons case is how different regions respond to the RTO mandate The tech behemoth announced in September that it would require its staff to be in offices five days a weeka jarring shift from a hybrid work setup that had been in place for the years prior owing to the pandemic The only exceptions to the rule would apply to those whove already been approved for the approved or had extenuating circumstances In the US Amazon reviews remote work requests on a casebycase basis rather than making it the norm However there might be more room to maneuver if Amazons employees were based in Europe according to a report by Business Insider The Seattle WAheadquartered retail giant is supposedly allowing greater flexibility for some employees in Europe The outlet cited the Netherlands as an example where employees were sticking to an earlier guidance of workfromhome for up to two days a week A memo sent to Dutchbased employees late last month suggests that the management in the Netherlands is still in talks with its workers council on workplace flexibility Until further notice while everyone is welcome and encouraged to work from the office for five days per week you may continue to follow the current inoffice guidance for your

Sherwood told Fortune When your workforce is your central asset then communication is key she said Blanket policy in any jurisdiction without any considerations on a casebycase basis which is what the Flexible Working legislation in the UK effectively enforces is likely to result in employees voting with their feet Companies typically solicit employee feedback and then consider the motivations behind an RTO mandatewhether its for collaboration or simply to revert to prepandemic work styles Amazons CEO Andy Jassy already faced criticism from his employees when he announced the companys sharp Uturn in hybrid work policies which upended many of their lives Experts speculated that the harsh new policies could be a form of backdoor layoffs or indirectly shrink the companys headcount as people would be forced to leave if they dont plan to comply Amazon has denied this Amazon has now delayed its RTO mandate which was meant to take effect on Jan 2 in several locations due to space constraints Representatives at Amazon pointed Fortune to Jassys September memo when approached for comment Many companies have eased employees back into office work by starting with a few days in person and eventually ramping it up Others including the early adopters of aggressive RTO rules such as Goldman Sachs have stuck out like sore thumbs as employees are expected to adjust their work patterns

results A perfect moneymaking market backdrop may not continue for much longer as investors digest rising bond yields bloated valuations and uncertainty over further interest rate cuts That was a fresh warning on Thursday from Goldman Sachs The powerful rally in equity prices in recent months leaves equities priced for perfection Goldman Sachs strategist Peter Oppenheimer wrote in a note to clients While we expect equity markets to make further progress over the year as a whole largely driven by earnings they are increasingly vulnerable to a correction driven either by further rises in bond yields andor disappointments on growth in economic data or earnings Although Oppenheimer stopped short of predicting a nearterm correction loosely defined as a 10 pullback from a high in stocks he offered up three plausible reasons for investors to perhaps lighten up on risk in their portfolio right now Read more TD Ameritrades former CEO makes his 2025 market prediction For starters Oppenheimer pointed out that the speed of the recent rises in stock prices likely reflects much of the good news that Wall Street is expecting on growth in 2025 Concern that strong future growth is already reflected in valuations could be seen this week with market darling Nvidia NVDA a stock that has exploded 185 in the past year Investors were left yearning for more from CEO Jensen Huangs closely watched CES keynote on Monday evening In response the stock on Tuesday notched its worst day since Sept 3 Other richly valued momentum names such as Palantir PLTR and AMD AMD have sold off more than 10 in the past month as traders price in a more elevated interest rate backdrop among other factors You could look at names like Palantir Tesla some of the selloffs that were seeing I think broadly were just going to see some white knuckles in the next six months Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said on Yahoo Finances Opening Bid podcast see video above listen below Trump headline risk tariffs 10year Treasury as it goes to 5 and what does it mean for Fed are all risks and so I think were going to see some of that volatility Oppenheimer also pointed out that high valuations for stocks are likely to limit forward returns Goldmans research found that its extremely difficult for companies to maintain high levels of sales and profit margins over sustained periods of time Therefore that sets the stage for investors to be let down by performance and opt to sell stocks Stocks are also likely to face stiff competition from other assets see bitcoin during the next decade Goldman estimated the SP 500 GSPC will have a total return of only 3 over the next decade This return would rank in the seventh percentile of 10year returns since 1930 Goldmans data shows And lastly Oppenheimer reasoned that unusually high market concentration increases portfolio risks The strategist is particularly concerned that the five biggest stocks in the US Apple AAPL Nvidia Microsoft MSFT Alphabet GOOG GOOGL and Amazon AMZN make up about a quarter of the SP 500 That concentration raises the prospect for a broader market correction if any of these companies disappoint in their results or trading conditions go risk off Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan thinks that continued dominance of growth stocks could make the market more topheavy than it is If the

splitadjusted gain of about 2470 over the past five years as the AI revolution has kicked into high gear As of this writing Nvidia is the most valuable publicly traded company in the US stock market with a market cap of more than 37 trillion Dont get me wrong I dont think Nvidia is a bad stock to buy right now But I do think that after the current wave of AI investment subsides the days of exponential stock price growth will be in the past and well see a period of somewhat muted gains in the tech giant At about 33 times trailing12month sales its fair to say that theres a lot of growth priced into the stock at the current valuation While nobody has a crystal ball that can accurately predict future market caps of companies I wouldnt be surprised to see Nvidia have a valuation of about 5 trillion a decade from now If this is correct there are several stocks that I believe will surpass the 5 trillion level within the next decade Here are two in particular I think have a good chance of overtaking the AI chip leader within the next 10 years Its rare to find a company with not one but two dominant businesses but Amazon NASDAQ AMZN is in this category And not only does Amazon lead the market in two completely different businesses but both also have significant room to grow If Amazon continues to execute and take advantage of industry tailwinds its 24 trillion market cap could be much higher Ive said in the past that I believe Amazon will ultimately become the first member of the 5 trillion market cap club and while I said that before Nvidias massive run it still wouldnt surprise me On the ecommerce side of Amazons business the company has a larger market share than its next 10 competitors combined But that doesnt mean it cant keep growing Ecommerce makes up only about 16 of US retail sales and this percentage has been steadily climbing for the past couple of decades Plus the bulk of Amazons ecommerce revenue still comes from North America and the international opportunity is still enormous When it comes to the Amazon Web Services AWS cloud infrastructure business its even more exciting Amazon doesnt have quite as dominant of a market share as in ecommerce Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT and Alphabet NASDAQ GOOGL NASDAQ GOOG are the other big players but the market itself is growing fast In fact the cloud computing market is expected to roughly triple in size globally by 2032 Plus AWS is by far the more profitable side of the business and could fuel doubledigit earnings growth for years to come Alphabet is best known for its Google subsidiary and has a market cap of about 24 trillion as of this writing With a valuation of just 23 times forward earnings theres also a solid case to be made that it is the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven stocks right now Indeed this massively profitable industry leader with a 28 net margin could be a bargain right now Its Google Services segment which includes Search Gmail YouTube Chrome and most of Googles other consumerfacing products could be a beneficiary of improving ad revenue in a strong economy as well as the probusiness and deregulation policies that are likely to come with the incoming Trump administration The other segment Google Cloud is a direct competitor with AWS and benefits from the same industry tailwinds Plus Alphabet has tremendous financial flexibility to take advantage of growth opportunities or to opportunistically return capital to shareholders through buybacks or dividends it is the only stock on this list that is a dividend payer The company generates bottomline profits at a rate of more than 100 billion annually plus it has more than 93 billion in cash and shortterm investments on its balance sheet Lets be clear Whether you buy Nvidia Amazon Alphabet or a combination of the three I dont think theres any way you can go wrong These are three extraordinary and wellrun businesses and Id be shocked if all three arent worth substantially more in a decade That said while the AI hype has pushed all three higher it has caused a tremendous amount of future growth and profitability to be priced into Nvidia so I could see these two stocks outperforming as Nvidias business catches up to its stock price Before you buy stock in Amazon consider this The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10

cash in on a rising tide Sound consumer demand lower interest rates and low unemployment in her view will provide a broad base of support for the overall economy and for her own preference of internet stocks We remain opportunistic within the Internet sector We expect fundamentals to remain stable with healthy topline growth from penetration gains product launches ongoing margin expansion and capital allocation efforts Khajuria opined Getting into specifics the 5star analyst has selected Amazon NASDAQAMZN and Meta Platforms NASDAQMETA as two of the best internet stocks to buy right now According to the TipRanks database these Magnificent 7 stocks have also earned a Strong Buy rating from the rest of the Street Lets dive into the details and take a closer look at each of them Amazon The first stock well look at Amazon is the world leader in ecommerce and a fastgrowing giant in both cloud computing and AI services Amazon was founded in 1994 and has proven itself to be a survivor the company lived through the dotcom bubble burst and has grown out of its origins as the online bookseller to become the digital worlds onestop shop As the global ecommerce leader Amazon boasts that it can deliver any product to any place and it follows through The result is a behemoth of a company with a market cap of 239 trillion Amazons online retail is its core business and made up 83 of its total revenue in the third quarter of 2024 the last period reported Of its 1314 billion revenue haul 955 billion came from the North America segment 359 billion came from international sales The company saw its highest yearoveryear revenue growth in its cloud computing subscription service AWS which expanded 19 yy to reach 275 billion Amazons overall Q3 revenue came to 1589 billion up 11 from the prior year and beating the forecast by 16 billion Amazon reported a free cash flow of 477 billion for the 12 months ending on September 30 2024 up 123 yearoveryear and the company finished Q3 with more than 78 billion in cash and liquid assets on hand What all of this means is that Amazon has deep pockets and plenty of resources to expand and modernize both its ecommerce and cloud computing activities The company is doing just that and is making strong use of AI as it does so On the retail activity side Amazon is using AI to improve its customer interfaces The company has introduced an AIpowered shopping assistant to smooth out the process of searching the retail database for exactly the right product at the right price and already uses AI to improve its online advertising activities On the cloud side Amazon is integrating AI capabilities and tools into the AWS platform and is working with the AI development company Anthropic to build generative AI models for Bedrock Amazons own AI cloud platform In addition Amazon under the AWS aegis is developing and releasing a family of semiconductor chips Trainium designed specifically to train AI and natural language systems At the bottom line all of this has made Amazon enormously profitable The company realized earnings of 143 per share in 3Q24 a figure that was 29 cents better than the forecasts In addition Amazons stock is up 49 in the last 12 months outperforming the NASDAQs 31 gain by a wide margin Checking in with analyst Khajuria and the Wolfe view we find her bullish on Amazon specifically citing the companys strengths Khajuria writes We named AMZN as a top pick at the time of our launch in July 24 and we continue to remain constructive on it based on our threepronged thesis i Upside to retail margins driven by operational efficiency gains automation Ad revenue growth and sustainable Intl profitability ii Healthy sustainable AWS revenue growth in the HT range driven by demand for AIbased workloads and inference Trainium chips and Anthropic iii Ongoing market share consolidation driven by fast delivery speeds and availability of nondiscretionary items Moving forward from this stance Khajuria puts an Outperform ie Buy rating on AMZN stock This is complemented by a 270 price target that implies a oneyear upside potential of 21 To watch Khajurias track record click here Overall this megacap ecommerce giant has earned a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street based on 47 recent analyst reviews that show a lopsided split of 46 Buys to just 1 Hold The shares are priced at 22211 and their average target price of 24962 suggests they will gain 12 in the year ahead See AMZN stock forecast Meta Platforms The second stock well look at here today is Meta Platforms the global leader in social media and the parent company of Facebook along with Instagram Messenger and WhatsApp Metas family of social apps had a collective DAP or daily active people of 329 billion in September 2024 meaning that this company can effectively reach 41 of the worlds population Thats a huge number and it underscores just how effective Mark Zuckerbergs company has been at building social media into a global force Meta has used its unprecedented reach to support its revenuegenerating activities primarily digital advertising The companys huge audience gives it access to an enormous well of data which can be used to finetune online advertising campaigns or simply sold to advertisers In its last quarterly report covering 3Q24 Meta reported an 11 yearoveryear increase in the average price paid per ad on its platform This solid metric helped push the companys total revenue in the quarter to 4059 billion beating the forecast by 280 million while growing 19 yearoveryear Metas stock like Amazons above has outperformed the broader markets by a wide margin gaining 73 in the last 12 months That Meta is successful is beyond doubt The company has achieved this success by adapting to changes in the digital landscape some of those changes brought on by the very social media revolution that it helped to start One good example is the companys reaction to the strength of Twitter or X as owner Elon Musk has rebranded it Meta developed its own threadsbased app appropriately dubbed Threads which it launched in July 2023 as a competitor While Threads has not yet reached the popularity of X it has reached the milestone of 200 million active users Meta also stands to gain from an Act of Congress which was upheld at the Federal appeals level last month The act orders the Chinese company ByteDance to divest itself of the popular social video app TikTok if it wants to keep the app available in the US If the Chinese company does not comply it risks having TikTok banned from US internet providers While enforcement of such a ban would be difficult at best the prospect of it may give a boost to Meta Meta has developed several social video apps of its own Reels and Stories on Facebook and is strongly positioned to grab a large part of TikToks 170 millionstrong audience should the Chinese app face a ban The upshot to all of this is that while Meta may be the old man in the rapidly evolving social media world it is hardly moribund The company is smart and adaptable and has proven itself capable of meeting changing conditions while realizing sound profits Its 3Q24 earnings figure came to 603 per share beating the forecast by 74 cents and growing 37 yearoveryear For Wolfes Khajuria the key here is that Metas combination of social apps its strength in video apps and its ability to meet changing conditions make the company a top pick As she puts it We remain constructive despite the significant outperformance over the last two years given our view that Street estimates offer upside Our thesis i We think video unification remains underappreciated based on our detailed analysis we forecast upside to 2025 Street ests by MSD B ii We size Threads opportunity as potentially adding LSD Bs with monetization starting in 25 iii TikTok divestiture remains uncertain but should that happen we see 8 to 10 upside to EPS iv Cleaner AI narrative as multiyear investments have better positioning to show ROIC potential Bottom line Khajuria puts an Outperform ie Buy rating on Meta and backs that with a 730 price target showing her confidence in a 16 upside potential over the next 12 months Meta has 43 recent analyst reviews on file and these break down to 39 Buys 3 Holds and 1 Sell The shares are currently trading for 61789 and the average target price of 68372

your account Its always heartening to see the business establishment stand up for constitutional principles Well almost always Among the exceptions is when business leaders wrap themselves in the Constitution to secure their own privileges at the expense of the public interest Thats the case with a curious little lawsuit the California Chamber of Commerce and California Restaurant Assn dropped in Sacramento federal court on New Years Eve Their target is Senate Bill 399 otherwise known as the California Worker Freedom from Employer Intimidation Act which was signed by Gov Newsom on Sept 27 and took effect on New Years Day It should be clearthat a captiveaudience meeting is an extraordinary exercise and demonstration of employer power over employees National Labor Relations Board The law is straightforward It bans captive audience meetings which are those scheduled by employers to ply workers with religious political and especially antiunion propaganda Nothing in the law bars employers from holding such meetings when worker attendance is voluntary The captive part the law specifies is when employees face discharge discrimination retaliation or any other adverse action for failing to attend As my colleague Suhauna Hussain has reported 10 other states have implemented similar bans So far theyve survived legal challenges Bans on captive meetings are under consideration in at least five other states They also were outlawed by the National Labor Relations Board with a ruling on Nov 13 overturning an antiunion policy dating from 1948 The 31 ruling with the boards Democratic members in the majority and its sole Republican in dissent involved Amazoncoms campaign against a union organizing drive at New Yorkarea facilities Amazon has said it will appeal the ruling Captive audience meetings are among the most pernicious and coercive tactics an employer can use to browbeat and intimidate workers into voting against a union says William B Gould IV an emeritus professor of law at Stanford and a former chairman of the NLRB and the California Agricultural Labor Relations Board The NLRBs November ruling applied to captive meetings involving unionization drives which fall within the boards jurisdiction The California law goes further by bringing meetings involving political and religious matters into the mix But the state laws and the NLRBs ruling make the same distinctions between meetings at which attendance is voluntary and those that workers are required to attend on pain of discipline The first are legal the second illegal Since they were seemingly blessed by the NLRB in 1948 captive audience meetings have become a common feature of corporate antiunion campaigns the board observed in the Amazon case A 2009 study of 1004 NLRBsupervised union representation elections cited in its ruling found that captive audience meetings had been held in 89 of cases more than half of the employers had held more than five in the runup to an election Read more Column Trumpfriendly billionaires are taking aim at the federal agencies that protect workers and consumers The Amazon campaign is a good example In opposing the unionization drive which was ultimately successful Amazon scheduled mandatory meetings every 45 minutes six days a week at the Staten Island NY warehouse where the drive originated At these meetings company representatives delivered speeches attacking unions in general and the Amazon union drive specifically The NLRB found that managers personally notified employees that they were scheduled to attend escorted them to the meetings and scanned their ID badges to digitally record attendance Amazons activities prompted the board to reconsider the 1948 policy which was set forth in a case involving the boiler company Babcock Wilcox The board noted that the 1948 finding that captive audience meetings didnt violate labor law was largely unexplained and flawed under the law So it was bound to be overturned In its detailed analysis of the topic the board cited numerous past board rulings and Supreme Court decisions that say that employers have the right to express their opinions about unions and unionization but not to compel employees to listen It should be clear the board found that a captiveaudience meeting is an extraordinary exercise and demonstration of employer power over employees especially when the employees decisions on whether to join the union is at issue That brings us back to the lawsuit the Chamber and Restaurant Assn filed in Sacramento federal court The lawsuit asserts that any ban on mandatory meetings infringes the employers freespeech rights as enshrined in the 1st Amendment State officials havent yet filed a response Because of SB 399 the plaintiffs say employers in California are now subject to liability penalties and other administrative action when they exercise their federal constitutional and statutory rights to talk to employees We think the plaintiffs do protest too much to quote Shakespeare The California law does nothing of the kind Read more Column Trumps proposal to make overtime pay taxexempt obscures how awful he was for all workers Under the bill employers are not prevented from speaking to employees in any way on any subject including about religious and political matters the AFLCIO stated in a legal memo for the California Labor Federation which supports the law Its worth remembering that employers notably restaurant owners arent above using dubious claims to attack proworker initiatives Back in June I reported that fast food franchise owners asserted that Californias 20 minimum wage for fast food workers had cost the state 10000 jobs in that sector going back to September 2023 when Newsom signed the law I documented that the statistic was false it was the product of a misinterpretation of government employment statistics that appeared initially in the Wall Street Journal and was repeated by UCLA economics professor Lee Ohanian for an essay on the Hoover Institution website Hoover subsequently retracted Ohanians essay which had been specifically cited by the fast food camp for a newspaper ad The plaintiffs may have a stronger argument in their assertion that Californias law governing employer rights in unionization cases is preempted by federal law namely the 1935 National Labor Relations Act The AFLCIO memo argues that California like any state has the right to set minimum employment standards for workers in the state The examples it cites however are matters such as child labor laws minimum wages and occupational safety and health standards though it also maintains that since states can bar the firing of workers for improper reasons such as race it can bar discharges for failing to attend a mandatory meeting Gould for one thinks the plaintiffs may have a point based on a 1959 Supreme Court ruling that gave the NLRB exclusive jurisdiction over unionization issues unless the board disavows an interest The issue might well be headed for the Supreme Court for another look That might not matter if the NLRBs decision in the Amazon case stands But a Trumpdominated labor board which appears to be preordained could overturn the Amazon ruling just as the Biden board overturned Babcock Wilcox That might not be the worst change in labor policy for workers as Trump succeeds Biden who may have

the highest level since October as the US announced new sanctions against Russia","Excitement over the hot technology of artificial intelligence AI helped the stock market soar last year and the movement may be far from over This is because were still in the early stages of AI development Companies have invested in data centers and building AI platforms but theres much more work to be done there Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA chief executive officer Jensen Huang has said about 1 trillion in outdated computers exist and must be updated for accelerated computing On top of this the actual use of AI to improve efficiency at businesses or develop new gamechanging products is in its early stages That suggests theres plenty of room for AIdriven revenue growth ahead meaning 2025 could be another great year for AI stocks Lets check out my top five to buy at this stage of the AI race Im mentioning AI chip giant Nvidia for one important reason Some investors have worried that after gaining 800 over the past two years performance may stall Its impossible to guarantee or predict with 100 certainty that a particular stock will advance during a given time frame But its reasonable to be optimistic about Nvidias potential this year and over time for a couple of reasons First Nvidia is the AI chip leader has built an entire ecosystem of AI products and services and to ensure its leadership the company has committed itself to annual innovation This along with the fact that Nvidia is launching a major new product right now the Blackwell architecture are positive points for the near term Second were now heading into a new AI growth phase The development of agentic AI or the use of AI to handle complex multistep tasks Nvidia offers developers tools to build these AI agents So moving forward Nvidia should benefit from accompanying its customers all they way along the AI path from training models to applying AI in the real world SoundHound AI NASDAQ SOUN specializes in voice AI and its technology of translating voice directly to meaning bypassing the usual text step has helped it to stand out The company has delivered incredible growth in recent times for example in the recent quarter revenue soared 89 But much potential lies ahead This is because SoundHound is in the early days of tackling a total addressable market of 140 billion Just a year ago about 90 of revenue came from automotive customers In the recent thirdquarter report five industries each contributed 5 to 25 of revenue This is a positive sign showing that SoundHound is winning over customers across industries and wont depend on just one And SoundHound is another company that could benefit from the AI agent boom offering opportunities for companies in industries such as healthcare insurance and travel to gain in efficiency for example managing appointments or bookings or responding to coverage questions SoundHound shares have surged over the past year but the good times may not be over for this potential agentic AI winner If youre looking to invest in AI but you want to minimize risk Amazon NASDAQ AMZN may be the perfect choice for you The company doesnt depend uniquely on AI for its success and has delivered a long track record of growth well before AI started picking up momentum This is because Amazon is a leader in two highgrowth businesses ecommerce and cloud computing And these businesses continue to offer the company bright longterm prospects In addition to this Amazon also is benefiting from its investment in AI The company uses AI to improve efficiency in its warehouses for example and sells AI products and services through its Amazon Web Services AWS cloud business And Amazons investment already has started to bear fruit Thanks to its AI offerings AWS has reached a 110 billion annualized revenue run rate Amazon may not deliver tripledigit share price gains but this solid profitable player has what it takes to help investors progressively grow wealth and that makes it a great buy now Meta Platforms NASDAQ META is another company thats invested heavily in AI but isnt completely dependent on it for revenue Instead Meta generates most of its revenue through advertising Advertisers flock to reach us where they know theyll find us using Metas popular social media apps Facebook Messenger WhatsApp and Instagram This has helped the company grow revenue over time into the billions of dollars and even reward shareholders by offering a dividend So where does AI fit in the Meta picture The company has built its own large language model LLM which its trained to support its own AI assistants and offers as an opensource tool to others Meta aims to create AI assistants for all of its users and this could prompt us to spend even more time on the social media apps we already love Importantly that could strengthen advertisers commitments to Meta The investment in AI also could help Meta develop other products and services down the road and its commitment to making its LLM available to all developers could set it on the path to becoming an AI leader Palantir Technologies NASDAQ PLTR had an explosive 2024 reporting its highest profit ever joining the SP 500 and seeing its shares surge 340 But the stock may have farther to go possibly this year but particularly over the long term This is because two growth drivers should help boost revenue well into the future Palantir helps its customers aggregate their data and make better use of it In the past its biggest customer was the government but these days its been seeing doubledigit growth in commercial customer revenue And US commercial customers totaling only 14 four years ago have reached about 300 Palantir also launched its Artificial Intelligence Platform AIP a little more than a year ago and demand has taken off So the commercial customer and AIP could drive significant gains in revenue in the quarters to come and all of this may translate into more share price gains for Palantir in 2025 and beyond Before you buy stock in Nvidia consider this The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy

the global economy The latest developments in AI are still in the early stages making this a onceinageneration opportunity But its important to invest in the right companies that can successfully monetize and profit from where AI is going Here are two companies with excellent earnings growth prospects that can deliver attractive returns for years to come AI adoption is not only bringing major improvements to how businesses operate but also creating opportunities for emerging leaders in hardware and software Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD has seen tremendous sales growth for its advanced processors used in highperformance computing markets such as data centers The recent dip in the share price offers the chance to invest in this fastgrowing semiconductor company at an attractive valuation Revenue from AMDs data center business exploded in 2024 growing 122 year over year in Q3 But AMD is also seeing robust demand for PC processors where its client segment posted a revenue increase of 29 year over year last quarter AMD is now generating more data center revenue than Intel which shows a changing of the guard in the semiconductor industry AMD generated 24 billion in trailing12month revenue but management estimates that the market size for data center graphics processing unit GPU could reach 500 billion within the next three years After launching a year ago AMDs data center GPUs are expected to bring in 5 billion in revenue AMD also just launched its fifthgeneration Turin EPYC central processing units CPUs designed for AI and cloud computing which offer better performance and lower cost of ownership over previous generations Alphabets Google and other large cloud service providers are expected to adopt Turin this year According to Yahoo Finance analysts estimates call for earnings to be up 25 in 2024 and another 54 in 2025 Given this you would think the stock would trade at a high multiple of earnings but at the current 130 share price investors can buy AMD stock at a reasonable 25 times 2025 estimates Amazon NASDAQ AMZN is the leading cloud service provider with its Amazon Web Services AWS business benefiting from growing demand for AI services Because AWS generates most of the companys operating profit the stock could offer more longterm upside than investors realize AWS has grown rapidly since Amazon first created it in 2006 But corporate migration to cloud services is still in the early innings and the opportunities companies have to move data over to AWS and use AI services in the cloud seem to be accelerating the shift Revenue from AWS grew 19 year over year on a currencyneutral basis in Q3 and trailing12month revenue reached 103 billion It controls about onethird of the 300 billion cloud market which itself is growing quickly AI chip leader Nvidia has chosen AWS for its AI supercomputer dedicated to research and development a huge endorsement of AWS capabilities in performance and security Amazons investments in AI capabilities in AWS could benefit the entire company For example Amazon has launched AI shopping assistants for Amazoncom which could benefit sales in its retail business Amazon is a solid growth stock that can help investors profit from the AI boom While AWS is growing management is also focusing on lowering costs on the retail side which is boosting the companys profitability This powerful combo is fueling the stock to new highs and could send it higher in 2025 and beyond With analysts expecting earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 22 Amazon investors could potentially double their money in the next five years When our analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen After all Stock Advisors total average return is 891 a marketcrushing outperformance

portfolio","Tip Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results The 1976 movie All the Presidents Men perhaps provided one of the best threeword investing strategies around Follow the money No the film didnt use the phrase in the context of investing However the best stocks tend to generate the most money in terms of revenue profit and free cash flow Following the money can help you identify great stocks With that in mind here are three stocks to buy for 2025 that are practically money machines You wont find many companies that rake in greater sales than Amazon NASDAQ AMZN The ecommerce and cloud services giant generated revenue of roughly 620 billion over the last 12 months The consensus revenue estimate for Amazon in 2025 among analysts surveyed by LSEG is around 707 billion In the past Amazon didnt worry too much about delivering earnings and free cash flow Thats no longer true though Today the company is laserfocused on both The proof is in the pudding In the third quarter of 2024 Amazons earnings soared nearly 55 year over year to 153 billion with its free cash flow over the trailing 12 months skyrocketing 123 to 477 billion Amazon also has an enormous cash stockpile of around 88 billion This amount isnt far below the companys record level of cash at the end of 2021 buoyed by a surge in online shopping fueled by the COVID19 pandemic The most important thing to know about Amazon though is that it should continue to be a money machine Amazon Web Services has a massive growth opportunity as organizations move their apps and data to the cloud The ecommerce market still has significant room to expand Amazon is also pursuing new growth opportunities including healthcare and robotaxis Google parent Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL lags well behind Amazon in revenue generation The companys sales approached 340 billion over the last 12 months However its a different story with profit Alphabet delivered earnings of 943 billion over the past 12 months and 263 billion in the third quarter of 2024 alone The technology leader is no slouch in the free cash flow department either Alphabets free cash flow over the last 12 months topped 41 billion The company reported free cash flow of 176 billion in Q3 Most of Alphabets revenue around 87 comes from its Google Services which include Google Search YouTube Google Maps Google Play Android Chrome and devices Google Services is also the companys biggest profit source although Google Clouds profit continues to grow rapidly Should investors be concerned about regulatory threats I dont think so despite a major adverse court ruling for Alphabet last year My take is that the company should maintain its dominance in the search engine market while expanding its share of the cloud services market I also predict Alphabets Waymo unit will be a major contributor to growth by the end of the decade as the robotaxi market takes off Eli Lilly NYSE LLY might seem to be out of place on this list The drugmakers revenue of 409 billion over the last 12 months pales in comparison to Amazons and Alphabets sales figures Lilly generated only 84 billion in earnings over the last 12 months Its free cash flow was negative So why do I view Lilly as a money machine to buy for 2025 Sometimes following the money involves looking ahead Lilly is poised to generate a lot more money over the next few years than it has in the past The companys MounjaroZepbound franchise targeting obesity and type 2 diabetes stands out as a big factor behind my optimism The two brands which are the same drug under the hood combined to make 116 billion in the first three quarters of 2024 Analysts at UBS project the franchise could become the biggest drug ever Meanwhile Lilly claims other key growth drivers including autoimmune disease drug Taltz and cancer drug Verzenio The commercialization of its Alzheimers disease drug Kisunla is still in the early stages The company also has a promising pipeline featuring 24 latestage programs Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks Then youll want to hear this On rare occasions our expert team of analysts issues a

generating marketbeating returns over the long run As chairman hes helped Berkshire Hathaway deliver a compounded annual gain of more than 19 over 58 years thats as the SP 500 posted a compounded increase of about 10 during that period Buffett believes in buying quality stocks for a reasonable price and holding on for the long term and this strategy has shown itself to be a winning one And thats why investors are eager to hear about Buffetts latest buys and copy some of his moves Of course we may not be able to exactly reproduce Buffetts returns after all were not buying or selling every stock at the same moment as the investing giant But by getting in on some of his favorites and holding on we could score a significant investing win over the long haul just like Buffett Here are my top five Warren Buffett buys for 2025 Buffett has expressed regret that he didnt invest in Amazon NASDAQ AMZN during its early days saying he blew it But in 2019 one of his investment managers added shares of the ecommerce and cloud computing giant to the portfolio and Buffett has held on ever since Why does Amazon make a great buy today The company is a leader in the two highgrowth industries I just mentioned generating billions of dollars in earnings quarter after quarter and on top of this Amazon is set to benefit from the hot growth area of artificial intelligence AI Amazon uses AI to help make its operations more efficient saving time and therefore money for example AI helps determine the best delivery routes at a particular time And Amazon also sells AI products and services through Amazon Web Services AWS a move thats helped AWS reach a 110 billion annualized revenue run rate All of this makes the stock a nobrainer addition to your portfolio for 2025 Buffett is a big fan of CocaCola NYSE KO the beverage and probably an even bigger fan of the stock because hes held onto the shares since his original purchase in the late 1980s The billionaire likes the companys solid moat or competitive advantage and this is its brand strength and its solid presence in more than 200 countries worldwide This famous investor also likes CocaCola for the passive income its paid out year after year The cash dividend paid to Buffett grew from 75 million in the mid1990s to 704 million in 2022 Most investors arent able to invest enough to earn dividend payments at that level but even with a smaller investment you still could generate significant passive income over time Especially since CocaCola has demonstrated its commitment to dividend growth increasing payments for more than 60 years All of this means a purchase of CocaCola could boost your portfolio every year thanks to dividends no matter what the overall stock market is doing The famous investor doesnt own many technology stocks yet he holds shares of one of the worlds top tech companies In fact its Buffetts biggest holding Im talking about Apple NASDAQ AAPL maker of the iPhone Mac and other topselling products Buffett appreciates the companys smart leadership calling Apple chief executive Tim Cook brilliant in a shareholder letter back in 2021 The top investor sold some of his Apple shares last year but suggested the move was to lock in profits at the current capital gains tax rate So its clear Buffett still believes in the companys longterm potential Apple is another company offering a solid moat as iPhone customers eagerly wait for the next version and arent swayed by less expensive competitors And the companys solid base of installed devices today equals another revenue stream services revenue Its been reaching records quarter after quarter So now is a great time to add this triedandtrue player to your portfolio and benefit from a new wave of growth driven by services American Express NYSE AXP is another longtime Buffett holding in fact in the billionaires latest shareholder letter he noted that he held onto the stock extending his Rip Van Winkle slumber that has now lasted well over two decades Buffett likes the credit card giant for its dividend payments as well as its long track record of earnings strength And recent reports suggest more growth ahead for the company In the latest earnings report revenue rose to a new record of more than 16 billion and based on this strength American Express increased its earningspershare guidance for the full year Importantly American Express is seeing growth among young customer groups millennial and GenZ customers are the companys fastestgrowing group in the US and they represent 80 of new accounts on the recently launched US Consumer Gold Card This suggests a new wave of growth ahead for this already wellestablished company meaning an investment in American Express could bring you the security of dividend payments as well as the potential for earnings growth ahead Buffett is known for stock picking but he also considers an overall bet on American companies a key part of his strategy and he even recommends it to others The billionaire does this by investing in SP 500 index funds those that mimic the composition of the index and therefore track its performance Buffett holds shares of the SPDR SP 500 ETF Trust NYSEMKT SPY and suggests this or another lowcost index fund make great additions to any portfolio You can buy the SPDR fund as you would a stock it trades daily just like a stock Exchangetraded funds come with fees as expressed through an expense ratio and you should choose those with ratios under 1 to ensure the fees dont eat into your returns The SPDR expense ratio is 009 so it fits our criteria The SP 500 since its launch as a 500company index in the late 1950s has delivered an annualized average return of 10 proving itself as an investment you can count on over time After all history shows us that even after the toughest times the SP 500 always has gone on to recover and eventually win So it makes sense to like Buffett bet on the best of American companies this

quantum computing stocks fell roughly 40 Wednesday after Nvidia NVDA CEO Jensen Huang told Wall Street analysts that very useful quantum computers are likely 20 years away Quantum computing stocks enjoyed a massive rally in late November and throughout December as growing interest and technological advancements fueled bets that the technology would take off sooner rather than later Though Huang sees the tech taking longer to reach practical applicability Nvidia is still betting on it Huang said Nvidia is working with just about every quantum computing company Nvidia in 2022 began extending its CUDA software development kit currently used by developers to make artificial intelligence applications for quantum software developers Even with their massive drops Wednesday Quantum Computing is up nearly 1400 from six months ago while Rigetti has risen more than 850 DWave has soared 360 and IonQ has jumped 265 over that time frame The US government gave a nod to the budding industry when a group of bipartisan US senators on Dec 3 introduced a bill that would reauthorize the 2018 National Quantum Initiative Act and pledged an additional 27 billion for quantum computing research to develop practical applications Then on Dec 9 Google introduced a new quantum computing chip called Willow and the company said it had found a way to increase the power of the chip while cutting down some of the problems associated with the technology typically the more powerful the quantum computer the more prone it is to errors In November Amazon launched a quantum computing advisory program saying in its announcement that the initiative will help AWS customers get ready for quantum computing IonQ said on Nov 18 that it had successfully run Nvidias quantum computing developer kit on its hardware Quantum Computing Inc said it had taken stock of advanced chips its using to advance its quantum software If you kind of said 15 years for very useful quantum computers thatd probably be on the early side If you said 30 is probably on the late side But if you picked 20 I think a whole bunch of us would believe it he said Responding to a question from Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis during a conversation with analysts at the tech industrys annual CES trade show in Las Vegas Huang said Quantum computing cant solve every problem Rigetti Computing stock was down 45 at market close while IonQ dropped 39 Fellow stocks in the sector DWave Quantum QBTS and Quantum Computing QUBT plummeted 36 and 43 respectively But Huang said the company will continue focusing on accelerated computing that complements quantum computing rather than diving headfirst into the space In the case of quantum computing it turns out that you need a classical computer to do error correction with the quantum computer And that classical computer better be the fastest computer that humanity can build and that happens to be us Huang told analysts Tuesday Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo

2024 investor letter During the quarter we initiated one new position in Meta Platforms Inc NASDAQMETA and had no liquidations Management at Meta has effectively addressed concerns about investment

threat to democracy they barred him from posting on their social media platforms We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg wrote on his platform on Jan 7 2021 one day after Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol in a violent attempt to keep him in power Today some of the same tech leaders including Zuckerberg are taking a strikingly different tone as Trump prepares to retake the White House They are meeting with him personally touting the business opportunities they see under his next administration announcing policies that appear designed to appease him and bankrolling the pageantry of his return with huge donations to his inaugural fund On Tuesday four years to the day since his post announcing Trumps Facebook suspension Zuckerberg posted a video arguing that the complex systems his company has built to moderate dangerous illicit and misleading content have led to too much censorship a favorite argument of Trumps and will be dramatically scaled back Calling the recent elections a cultural tipping point Zuckerberg said Meta which owns Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp will get rid of fact checkers and instead rely on users to challenge misleading posts The company will greatly reduce its content restrictions on some of Trumps favorite political subjects such as immigration and gender he added and ratchet up the amount of political content its algorithms steer to users It also will move remaining safety and content moderation teams out of California and into Texas which Zuckerberg suggested would provide a less biased environment and work directly with Trump to push back on governments around the world that are going after American companies and pushing to censor more Read more Meta is following Xs playbook on factchecking Heres what it means for you Industry experts say the changes are part of a broader shift in public political posturing by big techs heavy hitters one that began long before Trumps November win but has escalated greatly since and is greater than the perfunctory bowing of pragmatic business leaders with the changeover in government every four years Some have defended the shift In an interview with the Associated Press last month Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff credited it to the incoming Trump administration showing more interest than the Biden administration in industry concerns and expertise I think a lot of people realize there is a lot of incredible people like Elon Musk in the tech industry and in the business community Benioff said If you tap the power and expertise of the best in America to make the best of America thats a great vision Others say the shift reflects a financial calculation in line with the libertarian streak that has long run deep in tech circles that Trumps penchant for deregulation and disdain for content moderation which he has claimed is biased against conservatives will be good for the bottom line the experts said The tech executives see an opportunity to wipe their hands of the expensive responsibility to clean up their platforms the experts said and a useful excuse to do so under the guise of free speech an ideal Trump has often cited in order to ridicule platform moderation It is a recognizing that Trumps power is enormous as weve seen through the election that hes definitely here to stay for these four years and that the MAGA movement is the biggest social movement in the United States said Ramesh Srinivasan director of the UC Center for Global Digital Cultures When it comes to Meta and these big companies their interest is in maintaining if not increasing their valuation andor profitability and theyre gonna go with whatever the easiest ways are to achieve just that That posture is unsurprising and financially savvy he and other experts said but also alarming particularly in light of Trumps promises to wield the Justice Department as a political weapon against his enemies and the tech leaders willingness to counteract that threat with cash and other consolations to the White House they said Sarah T Roberts cofounder and faculty director of the UCLA Center for Critical Internet Inquiry said the tech donations to Trumps inaugural fund were quite a vulgar demonstration that in order to succeed in the marketplace in the next four years it will require currying favor with the president A major problem is that decisions by Meta X and others to capitulate to Trump by tossing away years of accumulated knowhow and expertise in the area of content moderation are not in the best interests of platform users around the world who are harmed when such safeguards arent in place said Roberts author of Behind the Screen Content Moderation in the Shadows of Social Media The tech leaders know that too but dont seem to care she said They know from their own internal research that there is harm without measures and efforts to intervene and they are making very calculated decisions to ignore their own evidence dismantle those teams and sell out their own work and workers Roberts said Also at work said Rob Lalka a business professor at Tulane University is a longrunning strategy among big tech leaders to reshape American capitalism in their favor by gaining influence in Washington They are getting involved in politics in ways that go beyond the money he said Theyre interested in power Zuckerberg Elon Musk of X Tim Cook of Apple Jeff Bezos of Amazon Sundar Pichai of Google and other leaders in the cryptocurrency and AI industries who have backed Trump control platforms and services that play an outsize role in shaping civil discourse and political debate experts said An important check on their sweeping powers is government regulation which has increased in recent years as countries grapple with the threats such platforms pose to consumers and democracy including through the spread of misinformation and hate speech Individual nations and the European Union have increasingly issued mandates for content moderation and the safeguarding of children issued takedown orders for content deemed illegal or dangerous and filed antitrust and other litigation to break up or fine the companies for anticompetitive business practices Amazon Apple Google Meta and X formerly Twitter have all faced antitrust litigation or review in recent years some of which originated under the first Trump administration None responded to requests for comment though they have denied wrongdoing in court They or their chief executives also have all pledged donations to Trumps inaugural fund which pays for galas parades and dinners Read more Tech billionaires Zuckerberg Bezos and Altman help bankroll Trumps inauguration What to know Meta and Apples Cook have said they will contribute 1 million to Trumps fund Google has said its giving 1 million and that the inauguration will be streamed on YouTube Amazon led by multibillionaire Jeff Bezos has committed to giving 1 million in cash plus a 1million inkind contribution by streaming the inauguration on Amazon Video Musk the worlds richest man spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars the most of any single donor in the 2024 election cycle to help reelect Trump and Republicans in the House and Senate including through two separate political action committees campaign finance filings show Musk has been in Trumps inner circle ever since and Trump has appointed him to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency Read more An industry behemoth Inside the federal governments efforts to break up Google Bill Baer former head of the Justice Departments Antitrust Division in the Obama administration said the tech leaders are currying favor which he added was not a crazy thing for them to be doing given Trumps focus on loyalty They want to make sure that if there is an enemies list being compiled theyre not on it Baer said Its also unclear how the Trump administration is going to handle tech platforms or the investigations into their operations Baer said Both Trump and Vice Presidentelect JD Vance have expressed some concern about tech platforms and there seems to be a mixed view among Republicans in Congress he said Baers concern however is that the Trump White House will make good on its promises to control law enforcement in a way that would allow it to protect its friends and to pursue its enemies and that includes people who are currently being sued on antitrust grounds as monopolists as well as people being investigated for those behaviors If Trump does so the tech leaders willingness to pay into his inaugural fund and appease him in other ways will raise legal questions Baer said especially if the antitrust cases against them suddenly go away or they get off easy Its something that the public ought to be concerned about Baer said Our whole economy is built on the notion that competition results

announcement Tuesday which followed another naming Dana White chief executive of Ultimate Fighting Championship and a staunch Trump loyalist to Metas board Trump simply said Zuckerberg has come a long way The remark was a nod to the argument by Trump and other Republicans that big tech is steeped in liberal bias and that its algorithms and content moderation are designed to help Democrats and hurt Republicans Experts say there is plenty of evidence to show that bias is a myth not least of all the latest actions of techs most powerful leaders But regardless of those leaders personal politics

and putting them in danger Lalka of Tulane and author of The Venture Alchemists How Big Tech Turned Profits Into Power said the fact that Trump is surrounded by tech leaders reflects how vastly Silicon Valley has shifted its posture on politics since 2016 when venture capitalist Peter Thiel raised industry eyebrows by donating 125 million to Trumps first campaign Lalka said Americans underestimate and should be better informed on the degree to which Silicon Valley types have since infiltrated government Vance among others also has deep ties to Thiel and how much they stand to permanently alter American governance to better serve their own free market interests Musks Department of Government Efficiency and the aligned plans under Project 2025 to fire career civil servants

but the index that really stood out was the Nasdaq It climbed 28 while the SP 500 rose 23 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 12 The Nasdaq heavily weighted in technology companies surged as investors piled into the industrys hottest new area artificial intelligence AI stocks Todays 200 billion AI market is forecast to top 1 trillion by the end of the decade and investors have sought to get in early on this highgrowth story The technology has the potential to transform many industries saving companies time and money while boosting earnings as a result And earnings growth often leads to positive stock performance As 2025 gets started its logical to ask this question After two years of gains will the Nasdaq keep up the momentum this year History says it will If we look at the past periods of gains since 1990 in five out of six cases the Nasdaq has climbed for three consecutive years or more Of course the market can surprise us and deviate from a trend but in general history has shown itself to be a solid guide Now lets look at my top AI stocks to buy before the Nasdaq takes off You may associate Meta Platforms NASDAQ META mainly with social media The company owns Facebook Messenger Instagram and WhatsApp which together have more than 32 billion users each day But Meta also is becoming a giant in AI developing its own large language model LLM to support tools we all can use like the Meta AI assistant The company made AI its biggest investment area last year and recently spoke of plans to continue increasing spending in this area It aims to create AI that can assist all of its users with their daily tasks workrelated projects and more This focus and the related investment could eventually make Meta a leader in this hot growth area and boost its revenue too For example the company generates most of its revenue through advertising and AI assistants may prompt us to spend more time on Metas apps encouraging advertisers to spend more to reach us there Considering all of this Meta shares trading at only 24 times forward earnings estimates even after last years 65 gain look like a bargain AI buy to snap up before the Nasdaq soars Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL like Meta may not be a company you automatically associate with AI You probably know it best for Google Search a tool many of us use daily But it is winning in AI in two ways First its LLM Gemini is helping it improve search and make the experience better for those who advertise across Google And second Alphabet offers AI tools and services including Gemini through Google Cloud its cloud computing business The focus on AI has helped Google Cloud reach milestones in recent quarters surpassing 10 billion in revenue and 1 billion in operating income The company does face one risk an antitrust case brought by the Justice Department A US district judge last year ruled Google hurt the competition in search But the company says it will appeal and it may be difficult for the government to apply the strictest of sanctions Like Meta Alphabet stock represents a bargain today trading for 21 times forward earnings estimates especially considering its long track record of growth its market leadership and its focus on AI This list wouldnt be complete without Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA Yes it already soared 171 last year and isnt the cheapest stock on the block at 45 times forward earnings estimates But I think its worth the price and has room to run in light of its position in the AI landscape Nvidia not only is the top AI chip company but it also has built an AI empire spanning various products and services It has even created platforms for particular industries like healthcare and automaking The companys chip dominance has helped it generate double and tripledigit growth quarter after quarter in recent years bringing revenue to record levels Sales topped 35 billion in the latest quarter But the momentum is far from over The company also is set to win in the next wave of AI growth the area of software Its enterprise software and tools that help customers build their own AI agents AI that solves complex problems could push revenue much higher in the years to come So Nvidia the star of the early phase of AI has what it takes to continue shining and thats why it makes a top buy before the Nasdaq soars in 2025 When our analyst team has a stock

in to access your portfolio","Tip Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results Artificial intelligence AI investing isnt just for 2024 Its still going to be a massive theme in 2025 As a result investors should examine their portfolios and see if they have proper exposure to the biggest technological shift since the growth of the internet Three AI stocks that investors should have on their radar are Meta Platforms NASDAQ META Salesforce NYSE CRM and Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA and all of them appear to be great buys now These three are large players in the tech space and have massive amounts of resources to throw at AI innovation This is key as there are many startups that are working in the AI space but they just cant compete with the leaders in some fields Meta Platforms is one of the companies competing in the generative AI model game with its opensource model Llama Choosing to make its AI model open source was a unique decision but it gives Meta some key advantages One of the biggest factors is that its free to use which makes it more attractive to many developers By default this increases the user base and broadens the data that is fed into its AI model This gives Meta a training advantage over some of its competitors and will help it develop one of the leading AI models Salesforce isnt competing with Meta in the generative AI model game its focusing on serving its existing client base with useful AI platforms Salesforce makes customer relationship management CRM software which is used for a wide variety of purposes including marketing and customer support Historically humans have done this but AI agents may change this notion Through Salesforces Agentforce its users can create AI agents that do these jobs and provide significant value to those deploying them Lastly Nvidia plays a key role in any AI model Its graphics process units GPUs are used to train these AI models and Nvidias are by far the best in the business This has provided huge growth in 2023 and 2024 but 2025 also looks to be more of the same Wall Street analysts project 51 revenue growth during its fiscal year 2026 ending January 2026 which indicates AI spending will stay elevated this year Additionally Nvidia is ramping up production of its nextgeneration GPU architecture Blackwell This technology provides massive improvements over the previous Hopper architecture including 4 times faster training performance for AI models Nvidia has been one of the top AI investments for a long time and will continue to be a great pick for 2025 All three of these companies have strong themes heading into 2025 but why are they great buys now From a pricetoforward earnings perspective these stocks are fairly attractively priced relative to their growth Meta is clearly the cheapest stock on this list and if you made made me choose one Id probably pick it as the best investment of the three Its 24 times forward earnings valuation isnt a bad price to pay for any stock especially one thats as dominant and innovative as Meta Compared to the Nasdaq100 which has a forward pricetoearnings PE ratio of 264 the stock is cheaper than many of its big tech peers Salesforce is a bit more expensive than this benchmark but it also has the most to gain in terms of growth from its AI investments Its AI agents have the potential to be a huge revenue boost for the company something it desperately needs as Wall Street only projects 9 growth this year Still Salesforce is working toward maximizing its profitability its profit margin currently sits at 16 Considering that some software companies can reach up to a 30 profit margin theres still a huge boost to be realized on that front Nvidia is the most expensive of the bunch but is also growing the fastest by far With its revenue expected to rise by 50 this year I think the 48 times forward earnings isnt a bad price to pay especially considering Nvidias dominant market position With the stock down a bit off of its alltime highs now looks like a great time to take advantage of the sale All three of these stocks are slated to have a solid 2025 and therefore make great buys in January Before

results In 2025 generative artificial intelligence AI models will become much more useful because many of the companies involved with building them have started to develop agentic AI This is the next phase and it basically involves AI agents acting like people While generative AI can be a useful tool on its own these agents can do things autonomously providing immense value to their users One company leading the way in this field is Meta Platforms NASDAQ META which powers its agents with its Cicero technology This could be a true game changer for Meta and open up some interesting opportunities Metas Cicero displayed its worth by competing in a board game called Diplomacy The company describes this game as a combination of the board game Risk poker and the TV show Survivor Clearly there are some technical and strategic decisions that AI can excel at but there are also negotiating and relationship tactics that AI models havent been known to excel at However Cicero shined in this game and scored in the top 10 of participants across 40 games This is a pretty big breakthrough It shows that AI models can be trained to reason with humans But how does this help Meta Because it is a social media platform through its Facebook Instagram WhatsApp Threads and Messenger apps having AI that understands humans like Cicero is crucial One way Meta is attempting to integrate this technology is by creating AI influencers Users having the ability to create AI influencers could boost interaction on the platform which would in turn boost ad revenue for Meta The verdict is still out on whether this strategy will be successful but dont be surprised to see more AIgenerated content on Metas platforms during the next year Furthermore the technology that Cicero uses is already integrated within Metas AI assistant so the ability to reason can be tested through Meta AI which is already available on its apps By interacting with this platform users are training Metas Llama large language model LLM to be more accurate and complex further boosting its usefulness Regardless these innovations improve Metas existing business not add a ton of new functionality So is the stock worth owning given the current state of the business Meta Platforms is already executing at a high level Revenue rose 19 in the third quarter with earnings per share EPS up 37 year over year That strength is expected to extend into 2025 with Wall Street analysts on average projecting 15 revenue growth Those are solid results and projections for a company of Metas size However the stock really isnt all that expensive Meta isnt valued at that great a premium over the broader market at 29 times trailing earnings and 24 times forward earnings The SP 500 SNPINDEX GSPC currently trades at 247 times trailing earnings and 214 times forward earnings Considering that other big tech companies that arent growing nearly as fast as Meta Im looking at you Microsoft and Apple are trading for a higher premium its safe to say that Meta stock is a solid buy right now Will AI agents be a big deal for the company By themselves I dont think so However their integration and adoption could further drive user interaction with its platforms and ensure they dont get left behind by other social media sites Meta Platforms is staying competitive in artificial intelligence which is crucial in what will likely be an AIdriven future Its still a great stock to buy right now but not solely for its AI agents Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms consider this The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst

phenomenal year for most megacap growth stocks which helped lead broader indexes like the SP 500 SNPINDEX GSPC to new heights Still some investors may be concerned that the rally is a bit overextended Even weak companies can see their stock prices rise when investors are optimistic However over time the bestperforming stocks are businesses that deliver on investor expectations and continue to innovate So with the SP 500 around an alltime high ensuring you are investing in quality companies is imperative Investing in dividend stocks is a way to collect passive income no matter what equity prices are doing Heres why Broadcom NASDAQ AVGO Visa NYSE V Salesforce NYSE CRM Meta Platforms NASDAQ META and Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL are well positioned as industryleading companies that can afford to raise their dividends through economic cycles and periods of volatility In their most recent quarterly earnings results Broadcom and Visa announced significant increases to their dividends for 2025 Broadcom hiked its payout by 11 and Visa boosted its dividend by 13 I would expect both companies to announce hikes of 10 or more again toward the end of this year Broadcom and Visa are textbook examples of dividendpaying growth stocks Both companies have impeccable business models Broadcom has network connectivity and artificial intelligence AI and Visa has a global payment processing network for debit and credit cards Since Broadcom and Visa are growing their sales and operating income at impressive rates they can afford to pass along a portion of profits to investors through dividends Over the last five years Broadcom has increased its dividend by 815 and Visa has nearly doubled its payout However the dividend payment isnt so large that it soaks up too much excess capital Longterm investors would prefer Broadcom rapidly expand its AI product lineup rather than divert precious capital toward a bloated dividend Visa reinvests in its business too but it spends the bulk of its capital return program on buybacks rather than dividends Visas relentless buybacks have reduced the companys share count by 11 in the last five years helping the company grow earnings per share faster than net income to help keep its valuation reasonable Broadcom yields just 12 and Visa yields 08 The low yields are due to substantial gains in both stocks not a lack of commitment to boosting payouts Meta Platforms Salesforce and Alphabet all began paying dividends in 2024 Meta initiated its dividend on Feb 1 when it reported its fourthquarter and fullyear 2023 results Salesforce announced its dividend on Feb 28 when it reported fourthquarter and fullyear fiscal 2024 results Alphabet announced its first dividend when it reported firstquarter 2024 results on April 25 I would expect all four companies to make regularly scheduled dividend raises once per year around the same time as their initial announcements fourthquarter earnings for Meta and Salesforce and firstquarter earnings for Alphabet All three stocks have yields of 05 or less at the time of this writing but I would expect all three companies to make annual doubledigit percentage raises for years to come and transform into dividendgrowth stocks like Broadcom and Visa All three companies are highly profitable and generate tons of free cash flow FCF despite ramping spending on AI FCF yield is a useful way of determining a companys theoretical payout if it passed along all of its FCF to investors through dividends Similar to dividend yield FCF yield is just FCF per share divided by the share price or total FCF divided by market cap Like dividend yield FCF yield goes down as a stock price goes up Salesforce Meta and Alphabet beat the SP 500 in 2024 which brought down their FCF yields However despite the big year and record research and development expenses all three companies still have solid FCF yields Each company can afford to substantially raise its payout and support it with cash without slowing down spending on longterm growth Broadcom Visa Salesforce Meta and Alphabet may not light up an income investors radar However dont be surprised if all five companies grow their payouts at impressive rates for years to come For now each companys dividend is merely the cherry on top of an already solid underlying investment thesis Investors looking to supplement income in retirement would do better with higheryielding stocks with multidecade track records of increasing payouts But investors who are more focused on total returns capital gains plus dividends than dividends alone should focus on a companys ability to grow earnings and in turn its dividend over time instead of what the yield is today Broadcom Visa Salesforce Meta and Alphabet have runways for future earnings growth making them dividendgrowth stocks worth considering in 2025 Before you buy stock in Broadcom consider this The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they

Masculine energy I think is good and obviously society has plenty of that but I think that corporate culture was really trying to get away from it Zuckerberg said during a nearly threehourlong conversation with podcaster Joe Rogan published on Friday Its like you want feminine energy you want masculine energy Zuckerberg said during the episode of The Joe Rogan Experience I think that thats all good But I do think the corporate culture sort of had swung toward being this somewhat more neutered thing he added before discussing his passions for mixed martial arts and hunting invasive pigs in Hawaii Zuckerberg who launched his career by rating the attractiveness of women at Harvard University added that he grew up with three sisters and has three daughters and wants women to succeed in corporations If youre a woman going into a company it probably feels like its too masculine Its there isnt enough of the energy that you may naturally have he told Rogan You want women to be able to succeed and have companies that can unlock all the value from having great people no matter what their background or gender Metas Policy Changes The podcast episode was released just days after Meta loosened its content moderation policies for Instagram and Facebook to allow more leniency for users criticizing immigrants transgender and nonbinary people or making exclusionary statements based on someones sex or gender On Tuesday Meta also announced the end of thirdparty factchecking in the US and on Friday the company said it was halting many of its internal training and hiring efforts aimed at making its workforce more diverse The Friday episode marked Zuckerbergs second appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience Rogan who is considered to be the most popular podcaster in the world has 19

the Biden administration during the Rogan interview claiming White House officials would scream and curse at Meta employees amid discussions about how to moderate content related to Covid19 during the pandemic It was brutal Zuckerberg said adding that the administration overstepped in its requests to take down posts about the pandemic including satire sowing distrust among the electorate He previously wrote about these complaints in a letter to Congress in August The US government should be defending its companies not be at the tip of the spear attacking its companies Zuckerberg said In contrast the Facebook founder said hes optimistic about Trump returning to the White House I think he just wants America to win Zuckerberg said President Joe Biden in a rare White House press

for how to cancel and delete Facebook Instagram and Threads accounts have seen explosive rises in the US since Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company will end its thirdparty factchecking system loosen content moderation policies and roll back previous limits to the amount of political content in user feeds Critics see the move as an attempt to cater to the incoming Trump administration and avoid political retaliation suggesting the consequences of Metas new policies could have serious implications for the types of posts hateful and violent speech and misinformation that can spread even faster than they already do across Metas platforms The backlash has been swift Interest in searches related to getting off Meta platforms rose this week particularly in the last two days Google searches for terms like how to permanently delete facebook hit a maximum score of 100 the highest level of interest possible on Google Trends According to Google Trends related searches like how to delete all photos facebook alternative to facebook how to quit facebook how to delete threads account and how to delete instagram account without logging in have become breakout

peaking to 100 around specific events like Metas latest policy changes and the presidential election in November 2024 The recent growth underscores a recoil against Metas decision to roll back protections against hateful speech and inflammatory political content Meta had put factchecking and content moderation policies into place after years of misinformation and violent speech proliferating on its platforms which have caused realworld harm Case in point the attempted insurrection at the Capitol on January 6 2021 which was fueled by coordinated calls for violence on Facebook and Instagram Internal documents revealed that Facebook did not act forcefully against the Stop the Steal movement pushed by Trumps allies even though the company had identified ways to diminish the spread of political polarization conspiracy theories and incitements to violence Meta has also admitted that its platforms were used to incite violence in Myanmar where members of the Burmese military committed genocide against the Rohingya people In 2021 Zuckerberg said that the Meta community doesnt want politics and fighting to take over their experience on our services leading to the companys push to scale back political discourse Last year the company also stopped proactively recommending political content to users on Instagram and Threads a move that was controversial among creators and users Now Meta will phase back in political content to feeds Zuckerberg said that the new policies are an attempt to restore free expression on Metas platform parroting comments made by Elon Musk on his platform X The Meta CEO noted that his platforms would replace thirdparty factcheckers with a community notes system akin to Xs in which users can flag posts they think need more context Over the same period Google searches facebook alternatives have also seen a bump as have searches for Bluesky and Mastodon two decentralized social media platforms that have been gaining in popularity since

protests against the police killings of George Floyd and other Black Americans in 2020 Meta is ending its diversity equity and inclusion DEI programs including those for hiring training and picking suppliers it said in an internal memo to employees on Friday the latest in a series of actions cheered by conservatives In less than two weeks Meta has scrapped its US factchecking program elevated

increase diversity in corporate America by requiring companies listed on the exchange to have women and minority directors on their boards or explain why they do not The term DEI has also become charged in part because it is understood by some as a practice that suggests preferential treatment of some groups over others Gale wrote Meta will no longer have a dedicated team focused on DEI Chief

to remain on Metas supreme court even as Facebook rewrites its moderation rules to allow claims that Jewish people are greedy or gay people are freaks Mr Rusbridger who is a member of Metas Oversight

Meta hasnt gifted control of its platform to Donald Trump Mr Rusbridger and Khaled Mansour another Oversight Board member wrote But its behaviour this week suggests a company which is extremely keen

policies But the future of the board has been called into question by a sweeping overhaul of Metas moderation policies by Mark Zuckerberg including scrapping its factchecking programme in the US and rewriting its rules on hateful conduct Among the changes to Metas public rules include an exception that will allow Facebook and Instagram users to describe homosexual or transgender people as

broadly banned a list of examples in training materials for moderators now laid out a variety of other permitted phrases such as immigrants are grubby filthy pieces of s Metas examples state that users are allowed to say phrases such as migrants are no better than vomit although writing Muslims make me want to throw up is banned as claiming a group causes sickness is not allowed Other statements such as comparing groups to rodents or pathogens are banned It came as Meta scrapped its diversity equity and inclusion DEI programmes in a further sign Mr Zuckerberg is looking to align the social media platform with the incoming president In an internal memo first reported by Axios Meta said it would end diversity policies in areas including hiring training and picking suppliers It

concerns The Conference on the Future of Europe website allowed signups via Facebook which Bindl claimed resulted in his internet address and browser details being transferred to the US The incident

status of having equivalent safeguards where Facebooks parent company Meta stores much of its data Bindl argued that this transfer risked his data being accessed by US security and intelligence services He sought 400 for nonmaterial damage and an additional 800 for the Commissions failure to respond to his data transfer inquiry The court rejected Bindls second request and a claim regarding data transfer to Amazons US servers confirming the data was stored in Munich The General Court finds that the Commission committed a sufficiently serious breach of a rule of law that is intended to

Meta CEO approved Metas use of the LibGen dataset notwithstanding concerns within Metas AI executive team and others at Meta that LibGen is a dataset we know to be pirated The legal action against Meta in was initiated in 2023 by authors including TaNehisi Coates and comedian Sarah Silverman The internal communications at Meta allegedly show that Zuckerberg sanctioned the use of the LibGen dataset despite internal concerns about its legitimacy Following the initial legal action US District Judge Vince Chhabria dismissed claims that Metas chatbots generated text that infringed on the authors copyrights and that the company had unlawfully removed copyright management information from their books However the authors contend that the new evidence strengthens their infringement claims and supports the reinstatement of their copyright management information claim as well as the addition of a computer fraud claim The plaintiffs are now seeking the courts permission to submit an updated complaint citing new evidence that the tech giant employed the LibGen AI training dataset known to contain pirated content and distributed it via peertopeer torrents During recent hearing

last year communications financials and consumer discretionary Even the technology sector underperformed the SP 500 last year In fact only 148 SP 500 components beat the index last year meaning over 70 of components underperformed the index Heres why these three standout sectors did well last year how they can carry the momentum forward this year and lowcost exchangetraded funds ETFs you can use to invest in each sector Communications was the bestperforming sector last year producing a 348 total return capital gains plus dividends The sector was led by its three highestweighted components Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Meta Platforms NASDAQ META and Netflix NASDAQ NFLX which rose 355 654 and 831 respectively in 2024 Besides social media and streaming companies the sector has traditional media giants like Comcast and Walt Disney telecom companies and more Despite running up in 2023 and 2024 the sector remains a good value going into 2025 Legacy media companies and telecom titans tend to pay dividends and feature inexpensive valuations Even Alphabet and Meta have reasonable valuations because they generate tons of free cash flow and solid earnings growth The sector depends heavily on advertising and consumer spending So a downturn in those categories could result in slowing growth and even a sectorwide selloff But the longterm outlook for the sector is encouraging especially given Metas success with monetizing Instagram and Netflixs expanding margins and pricing power Vanguard offers lowcost sectorbased ETFs with 01 expense ratios The Vanguard Communications ETF NYSEMKT VOX mirrors the sectors performance making it a simple yet effective tool for investing in stocks like Alphabet and Meta The financial sector was a standout winner in 2024 The sector includes Berkshire Hathaway big banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley regional banks payment processors like Visa Mastercard and American Express insurance companies and more The sector has done well amid relatively higher interest rates Banks can see expanded net interest margins during periods of higher rates because the difference between the rates they collect on lending like mortgages and car loans and what they pay on deposits and savings accounts widens But higher interest rates can also slow economic growth Last year stood out because economic growth was solid despite higher rates Integrated banks and investment banks thrived with many of those companies seeing record profits and stock prices Payment processors like Visa had slowing growth but were remarkably resilient thanks to network effects that led to moderate earnings growth despite pressured consumer spending The financials sector has run up a considerable amount so it isnt as compelling a value as it used to be But relative to the SP 500 it is still a decent value The Vanguard Financials ETF NYSEMKT VFH features a 171 pricetoearnings ratio PE and a 16 dividend yield compared to a 271 PE and a 12 yield for the Vanguard SP 500 ETF NYSEMKT VOO Economic slowdowns can affect the sector making it cyclical So investors should be aware of the potential volatility before diving headfirst into the Vanguard Financials ETF The consumer discretionary sector had a slow start to the year but a secondhalf rally by Tesla NASDAQ TSLA and a new record high for Amazon NASDAQ AMZN helped polevault it to a 266 total return in 2024 It contains industries you may have thought were in a different sector For example carmakers like Tesla and legacy automakers fall under the consumer discretionary sector although theres a case to be made that Tesla is more of a technology company and automakers like Ford Motor Company and General Motors are industrial Similarly Amazon and MercadoLibre are techfocused companies in the consumer discretionary sector The sector holds many familiar names like McDonalds Starbucks and Nike Like the other sector ETFs on this list the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF NYSEMKT VCR is fairly topheavy with a combined 457 weighting in Amazon Tesla Home Depot and Lowes Companies Beyond that the fund achieves solid diversification with 298 components It can be highly cyclical Slowdowns in consumer spending can affect home improvement budgets and lead to pullbacks on categories like expensive vacations or dining out Runups in Amazon and Telsa have made the sector more expensive with a PE ratio around the SP 500 average and a yield of just 07 But it can continue producing marketbeating gains if the economy grows reasonably and consumers open up their pocketbooks on discretionary goods and services The communications financials and consumer discretionary sectors include completely different

just to make a quick buck is a great way to lose your shirt However if you like a sectors top holdings for their longterm potential buying a lowcost ETF can be a great way to achieve diversification
