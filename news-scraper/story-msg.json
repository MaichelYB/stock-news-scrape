part of OpenAIs public program to award grants to fund experiments in setting up a democratic process for determining the rules AI systems follow In a blog post OpenAI announced users will not be allowed to build applications for political campaigning and lobbying until the company works out how effective their tools are for personalized persuasion Users will also be banned from creating chatbots that impersonate candidates or government institutions and from using OpenAI tools to misrepresent the voting process or otherwise discourage voting The company is also testing out a tool

books to train AI chatbots in the UK OpenAI submitted a plea to the House of Lords communications and digital committee OpenAI argued that it would be impossible to train AI models without using copyrighted materials and that they believe copyright law does not forbid training OpenAI published a public response to The New York Timess lawsuit against them and Microsoft for allegedly violating copyright law claiming that the case is without merit In the response OpenAI reiterates its view that training AI models using publicly available data from the web is fair use It also makes the case

startup OpenAI The chatbot uses GPT4 a large language model that uses deep learning to produce humanlike text November 30 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models The most recent model is GPT4o There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a signin in addition to the paid version ChatGPT Plus Anyone can use ChatGPT More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questionsconcerns Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT although others may limit the use of the AIpowered tool Most recently Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPTbased Bing experience into Windows 11 A Brooklynbased 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plugin geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space GPT stands for Generative PreTrained Transformer A chatbot can be any softwaresystem that holds dialogue with youa person but doesnt necessarily have to be AIpowered For example there are chatbots that are rulesbased in the sense that theyll give canned responses to questions ChatGPT is AIpowered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt Yes Due to the nature of how these models work they dont know or care whether something is true only that it looks true Thats a problem when youre using it to do your homework sure but when it accuses you of a crime you didnt commit that may well at this point be libel We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry Yes there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users Its not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit However users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words Yes it was released March 1 2023 Everyday examples include programming scripts email replies listicles blog ideas summarization etc Advanced use examples include debugging code programming languages scientific concepts complex problem solving etc It depends on the nature of the program While ChatGPT can write workable Python code it cant necessarily program an entire apps worth of code Thats because ChatGPT lacks context awareness in other words the generated code isnt always appropriate for the specific context in which its being used Yes OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface stored in the sidebar of the screen There are no builtin sharing features yet Yes There are multiple AIpowered chatbot competitors such as Together Googles Gemini and Anthropics Claude and developers are creating open source alternatives OpenAI has said that individuals in certain jurisdictions such as the EU can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form This includes

intelligence chips to adversaries such as China The White House said the rule would cap the number of AI chips called GPUs graphics processing units that can be ordered by most countries without a special license Smaller orders of 1700 or fewer GPUs would not count toward the export cap Artificial intelligence is quickly becoming central to both security and economic strength the White House said in a statement Monday The United States must act decisively to lead this transition by ensuring that US technology undergirds global AI use and that adversaries cannot easily abuse advanced AI Some 18 key US allies including the UK Netherlands and Taiwan will face no restrictions on shipments of AI chips and 24 countries that are subject to arms controls such as China North Korea and Russia still face an outright ban on receiving exports of the latest AI chips The primary significance of the updated restrictions is in their cap on the amount of compute capacity in a given group of AI chips that can be shipped to the remaining countries in the world Under the rule US companies could ship AI chips with a total processing power equal to roughly 50000 Nvidia Hopper chips or 20000 of its latest Blackwell chips Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said The countries subject to this cap include US allies like Switzerland and Israel For reference Microsoft MSFT alone reportedly purchased 485000 of Nvidias Hopper GPUs in 2024 while Meta META purchased 224000 of the AI chips according to the Financial Times The rule aims to close loopholes in prior export restrictions on AI chips in 2022 and 2023 by thwarting smuggling and raising AI security standards the White House said These restrictions will make it even more difficult for Chinese entities to purchase the most advanced NVIDIA chips DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance in an email Monday While there have been some restrictions on chip sales already there have been reports of advanced NVIDIA chips making it to China likely due to the fact that NVIDIA has limited control over its resellers Luria explained in an earlier email last week In addition to Nvidias advanced chips sold through resellers Nvidia makes specific versions of chips that comply with current US trade restrictions on China Sales of Nvidias H20 chips its Hopper chips for China should be unaffected by the controls Rasgon wrote in the note Nvidia vice president of government affairs Ned Finkle said in a statement Monday that the rule was drafted in secret and without proper legislative review And by attempting to rig market outcomes and stifle competition the lifeblood of innovation the Biden administrations new rule threatens to squander Americas hardwon technological advantage he said Companies have a longerthantypical 120day period to provide commentary on the restrictions Bloomberg reported giving the Trump administration time to make changes to the rule which is set to go into effect in one year Nvidias statement included a seeming appeal to the incoming administration As the first Trump Administration demonstrated America wins through innovation competition and by sharing our technologies with the world not by retreating behind a wall of government overreach Finkle said We look forward to a return to policies that strengthen American leadership bolster our economy and preserve our competitive edge in AI and beyond In a note to investors early Monday Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya reiterated his Buy rating on Nvidia stock but noted that the tougher export rule muddies the waters for the AI chipmaker Citi analyst Atif Malik said that while the news was not too surprising the new 50000 GPU export cap on 120 countries presents risks to Nvidias sales of GPUs for data centers which make up the vast majority of Nvidia revenue Nvidia stocks drop Monday extends its decline from Friday when shares dropped 3 in anticipation of the updated export controls It is now down around 9 over the last five sessions The stock was also under pressure after HSBC lowered its price target on Nvidia shares to 185 from 195 citing Blackwell supply chain concerns which it believes could remain an overhang through the first half of the companys fiscal year 2026 which occurs during the 2025 calendar year The Semiconductor Industry Association echoed Nvidias response to the rule stating Monday Were deeply

company name for relevant results Change is perhaps the only certainty on Wall Street Due to factors such as innovation competition mergers and acquisitions bankruptcies and legal judgments the puzzle pieces that make up the largest publicly traded companies are constantly in flux When 2004 came to a close ExxonMobil was the largest publicly traded company in the SP 500 with Citigroup and General Electric also in the top 10 Today Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT is the only member of the endof2004 top 10 thats still among Americas largest publicly traded companies Since the midpoint of 2023 weve witnessed Apple NASDAQ AAPL Microsoft and semiconductor colossus Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA all surpass the 3 trillion valuation plateau Although Nvidia would seem like the surest bet to reach the psychologically important 5 trillion level given the rise of artificial intelligence AI a darkhorse candidate may have the clearest path to become Wall Streets first 5 trillion company On one hand theres no denying that Nvidia has enjoyed a textbook operating expansion The companys Hopper H100 graphics processing units GPUs and successor Blackwell chips have been the preferred options for businesses wanting to run generative AI solutions and train large language models in their highcompute data centers With demand for GPUs overwhelming supply Nvidia has been able to command 30000 to 40000 for its Hopper chip which is up to four times as much as Advanced Micro Devices has charged customers for its Instinct MI300X GPU Having otherworldly pricing power helped to push Nvidias gross margin to as high as 784 last year While the longterm outlook for AI remains encouraging and this technology has realworld applications in most industries around the globe Nvidias chances of becoming Wall Streets first 5 trillion company are likely going to be thwarted by history Roughly three decades ago the internet began going mainstream and offered businesses a new way to connect with potential customers Though the internet did eventually alter the growth trajectory for corporate America is a positive way it took years before businesses really understood how to harness these new sales and marketing channels Including the internet every gamechanging technology or innovation for 30 years has navigated its way through an early stage bubble In simpler terms investors have consistently overestimated how quickly a new technologyinnovation would be adopted or gain widespread utility With most companies lacking clear game plans as to how theyll maximize the return on their AI investments it sets artificial intelligence up to be the next in a long line of bubbles Since no company has benefited more directly from the AI revolution than Nvidia the logical expectation is that its stock would be hit the hardest Historic precedent makes it unlikely that Nvidia ascends to a 5 trillion valuation first If history were to rhyme and the AI bubble bursts it would also be bad news for Microsoft which has been investing heavily in an artificial intelligencedriven future Although Microsofts operating cash flow isnt as overwhelmingly reliant on AI as Nvidia being the first to reach a 5 trillion valuation would be a stretch The same can be said for Wall Streets other 3 trillion public company Apple Though Apples Services segment continues to grow by a doubledigit percentage its physical device sales including iPhone have stagnated for two years Apple stock is already trading at one of its priciest valuations in a decade which leaves little room for its valuation to rise by another 14 trillion The Magnificent Seven component that appears to have the clearest path to a 5 trillion market cap is ecommerce juggernaut Amazon NASDAQ AMZN When most consumers and investors hear the Amazon name they think of its dominant online marketplace Last February eMarketer estimated that Amazon would account for just over 40 of US online retail sales in 2024 While this online retail platform has been the face of Amazon for nearly three decades ecommerce plays a minimal role in terms of cash flow generation and operating income The lions share of Amazons growth potential specifically growth in cash flow originates from its ancillary operating segments with Amazon Web Services AWS at the front of the pack Based on data from techanalysis firm Canalys AWS is the worlds leading cloud infrastructure service platform with an estimated 33 share of total cloud spending during the third quarter of 2024 For context Amazons share of spending among cloudservice providers is more than Microsofts Azure and Alphabets Google Cloud combined and these are the Nos 2 and 3 in global cloudservice spending Even though AI has played a role in AWSs growth enterprise spending on cloud services was growing at a steady doubledigit pace long before AI became the hottest thing since sliced bread on Wall Street With enterprise cloudservice spending still in its relatively early stages of expansion Amazon can expect substantially higher margins from this segment to meaningfully boost its cash flow Beyond AWS Amazons advertising services and subscription services eg Prime segments are also respectively growing by double digits Amazons push into exclusive sporting events Thursday Night Football and NBA streaming packages should improve demand for advertising as well as support its subscription pricing power The key point is that unlike Microsoft and Nvidia Amazon wouldnt be dragged down by the AI bubble bursting thanks to its abundance of other catalysts Lastly Amazon remains historically inexpensive Throughout the 2010s investors willingly paid 23 to 37 times yearend cash flow to own shares of the company But as of the closing bell on Jan 10 Amazons shares are valued at just 135 times consensus cash flow for 2026 If Amazon were to reach the median yearend multiple to cash flow it traded at consistently from 2010 through 2019 it would become Wall Streets

of business communications when after much debate and hesitancy from its CEO Bill Gates the company announced that it was acquiring the slideshow software PowerPoint Today PowerPoint has more than 500 million users worldwide and each day more than 30 million PowerPoint presentations are created Businesses rely upon it to conduct their Monday morning meetings Friday night crunch sessions and everything in between In little over three decades PowerPoint has become the way the corporate world presents itself But what if there was another way From the outset PowerPoint was marketed as a tool primarily for presenters In its marketing copy PowerPoint promised to be a cure for the presentation jitters and a surefire way to supercharge your presentations In his seminal discussion of PowerPoint American statistician Edward R Tufte argued that the way Microsoft sold the software revealed an immediate flaw that it is fundamentally presenteroriented rather than audience content or conversation oriented He claimed this caused a disparity between the two roles in a presentation PowerPoint allows speakers to pretend that they are giving a real talk and audiences to pretend that they are listening The distinctive style of PowerPoint Tufte concluded generates only the appearance of organised thought Tufte wrote his takedown in 2003 However while Microsoft has added many new upgrades to PowerPoint since then many of the assumptions he criticised concerning content and accessibility still hold For example it is still accepted that PowerPoint slides should ideally have as little text as possible so as not to overwhelm the audience On the face of it timesaving and audiencefriendly builtin practices such as bulleting seem effective But they have the consequence of bloating most PowerPoint presentations with far more slides than any audience member can reasonably engage with Another common assumption of PowerPoint is that every bullet point represents the tip of a thick iceberg of knowledge evidence and reasoning But often that is simply not the case In the rush to build decks PowerPoint creators are encouraged to either smooth over a narrative or forgo building one at all Instead adorned by icons and bullet points that hint at information known only to the creator every PowerPoint presentation becomes a closed fortress The result is an unshakeable sense of dissonance which would explain why it takes just six minutes for most people to switch off during a presentation In short PowerPoint doesnt help meet the presenters objectives At Fortunes Brainstorm AI conference in December 2024 Visas president of technology Rajat Taneja made a plea to artificial intelligence AI company founders to move away from PowerPoint and go to code He said this was crucial to stand out implying that most pitch slideshows could apply to any companynot ideal when getting funding relies upon illustrating your companys unique selling point USP The idea that PowerPoint is too much of a presenters tooland one which comes at the detriment of audience engagementhas played out in countless studies A 2017 study by Harvard Business Review found that audiences rated PowerPoint presentations comparably to a presenter with no visual stimuli It also found evidence that suggested audiences do not understand or retain information better from slideshows than an unaccompanied speaker The same study suggested that PowerPoint might not even be the best in its class It found individuals routinely rated a slideshow competitor Prezi higher perhaps because Prezis panningandzooming animations dont create the dreaded next slide please expectation This is a significant result given the platforms cultural familiarity Some 37 years on from its acquisition PowerPoint is no longer just a way to transmit information Instead the oncehumble slideshow software now represents the archetypal aesthetic of a business world in which appearance is often prioritised over realitya presentation culture The solution has to be a mutual one We need to start demanding more from our presenters and they in turn should feel comfortable demanding more from us

of enterprise AI software for the US military and large corporations and its revenue is growing in line with Statistas estimate Revenue growth has accelerated for seven consecutive quarters and grew 29 yearoveryear in the most recent quarter A key driver of growth has been strategic partnerships with leading cloud providers including Microsofts Azure cloud services business Microsoft recently expanded its partnership with C3ai which bodes well for the companys growth prospects C3ai signed 58 agreements last quarter including ExxonMobil CocaCola and US government agencies The negative for C3ai is weak profitability It reported an adjusted net loss of 006 per share in the last quarter and this is weighing on the stocks performance However investors can expect profits to follow more revenue growth as management expects the top line to grow faster than expenses over the long term If C3ai delivers the stock could be worth significantly more in another 10 years This is a relatively

markets are resorts restaurants and sports and entertainment where it is either the leader or No 2 player Quarterly revenue growth has averaged 36 yearoveryear over the last two years pointing to a big opportunity A key trend driving the companys growth is merchants moving from using multiple software providers to one system Some hotels might use one software system for checkin and another for its restaurant which is inefficient and costly Shift4 Payments solves this problem by offering a complete endtoend system that handles everything a merchant needs for payments security reporting analytics and more The company is building a competitive advantage that could sustain strong growth over the long term It is efficiently expanding by acquiring other businesses that have large pools of customers After it acquires a company Shift4 can crosssell thousands of new customers with bundled services The financing to acquire other businesses has left the company saddled with 28 billion of

near its alltime highs investors might be reluctant to buy new stocks as many have high valuations So today Ill highlight three oftoverlooked tech stocks that still arent too expensive relative to their longterm growth potential DigitalOcean NYSE DOCN Oracle NYSE ORCL and Dell Technologies NYSE DELL DigitalOcean is a cloud infrastructure company that serves up cheaper droplets of servers for small businesses and independent developers That unique strategy helped it carve out a niche in a market that was dominated by enterpriseoriented cloud giants like Amazon and Microsoft From 2018 to 2023 DigitalOceans revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 28 It also turned profitable in 2023 From 2023 to 2026 analysts expect its revenue and EPS to rise at a CAGR of 13 and 85 respectively As DigitalOcean continued growing in the shadow of its larger cloud competitors and it increased its exposure to the booming AI market by acquiring the startup Paperspace in 2023 and adding its GPUpowered servers to its platform It could have plenty of room to run as its niche market expands but its stock still looks reasonably valued at 40 times forward earnings Oracle is one of the worlds largest database software companies Over the past decade it expanded its cloudbased infrastructure and software services to pivot away from its onsite applications It also acquired a lot of companies including the cloud giant NetSuite and the healthcare IT leader Cerner to accelerate that evolution From fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2024 which ended in May 2024 Oracles revenue and EPS grew at a CAGR of 6 and 5 respectively But from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 analysts expect its revenue and EPS to rise at a CAGR of 12 and 21 respectively That acceleration will likely be driven by the generative AI market which is driving more companies to run their AI workloads on its Gen 2 cloud infrastructure platform Its stock isnt too expensive at 29 times forward earnings and its committed to returning a lot of its free cash flows to its investors through dividends and buybacks Its forward dividend yield of 08 isnt too impressive but its bought back more than a third of its shares over the past decade Dell was taken private back in 2013 after it diworsified its business with too many messy acquisitions but it returned to the public market as a more streamlined company in 2018 Today its still one of the worlds largest producers of PCs and servers From fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2024 which ended in February 2024 Dells annual revenue actually declined That drop was caused by its spinoff of Vmware in 2021 and a sluggish PC market But from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 analysts expect its revenue and EPS to rise at a CAGR of 8 and 24 respectively as the PC market stabilizes and its AI server business expands In its latest quarterly report Dell COO Jeff Clarke called AI a robust opportunity for the company with no signs of slowing down So while Dell might be growing as rapidly as Nvidia or other more popular AI companies it still looks like a dirt cheap play on that market at 12 times forward earnings It also pays a forward yield of 13 Before you buy stock in DigitalOcean consider this

our article on the 12 Best Technology Stocks to Invest In for the Long Term that covered this Lip was against the prevailing sentiment among investors that big tech has peaked and that funds should

valuations of many tech stocks he argued that they remain within acceptable historical norms On January 9 Mark Avallone president at Potomac Wealth Advisors joined The Exchange on CNBC to discuss why technology is the best sector to invest in right now He asserts that abovetarget inflation will prevent the Fed from implementing further easing measures countering the notion that higher rates are detrimental He noted that market rates have surged to alltime highs with a significant increase of 1800 points since October 2023 Avallone emphasizes that tech stocks particularly cashflowing megacap

relevant results American stock exchanges are home to nine technology companies with valuations of 1 trillion or more but only three have graduated into the 3 trillion club so far Apple 356 trillion Nvidia 334 trillion Microsoft 311 trillion Alphabet NASDAQ GOOGNASDAQ GOOGL is the worlds fourthlargest company with a market capitalization of 236 trillion as of this writing Its stock soared by more than 35 during 2024 and its currently trading near a record high Alphabet has become a leader in artificial intelligence AI and its embedding the technology across many of its legacy businesses including Google Search Lets explore why this tech giant has a clear path to joining the exclusive 3 trillion club in 2025 When OpenAIs ChatGPT application went mainstream in 2023 it offered an entirely new way to access information online Alphabet investors were concerned because Google Search is the conglomerates primary source of revenue and its 90 market share in the internet search industry was suddenly under threat Alphabet launched a decisive response which culminated in a family of its own AI models called Gemini with a chatbot of the same name The company also overhauled the traditional Google Search experience by presenting AIgenerated answers to queries that appear above the usual results This feature saves users from sifting through web pages to find the information they need Alphabet also went a step further recently when it launched AI Overviews for Google Search They incorporate text images and links to thirdparty websites to provide more complete answers to users queries The company discovered that links within Overviews receive more clicks than had they appeared in traditional search results so this new format could drive significant revenue as it gathers momentum Overviews recently rolled out to more than 100 new countries where they will reach 1 billion users every month and they might be the secret to protecting Googles dominant market share in the search industry The advertising dollars generated by Google Search accounted for 493 billion of Alphabets 882 billion in total revenue during the third quarter of 2024 ended Sept 30 Google Cloud on the other hand contributed just 113 billion However that figure represented growth of 349 compared to the yearago period whereas the search business generated growth of just 122 Q3 also marked the fourth consecutive quarter in which Google Clouds revenue growth accelerated and AI was a big part of the reason The platform is a goto destination for developers seeking the tools to build AI software whether its data center computing infrastructure or readymade large language models LLMs like Gemini Google Cloud operates several data centers filled with Nvidias industryleading graphics processors GPUs which are the most popular chips for AI workloads However Google also designed its own chips like the Trillium tensor processing unit Offering a mix of hardware helps Google Cloud differentiate itself from the competition but designing chips inhouse also unlocks a level of customization that can reduce costs and drive efficiency On the software side businesses can access more than 130 readymade LLMs through Google Cloud which they can use to accelerate the development of AI applications In a series of prepared remarks for Q3 Alphabet said the usage of Gemini alone soared by 14 times over the prior sixmonth period Alphabet generated 754 in trailing12month earnings per share EPS which places its stock at a pricetoearnings PE ratio of just 257 As you can see in the chart below its stock trades significantly cheaper than each of the 3 trillion giants I mentioned at the top There are two ways Alphabet could join the 3 trillion club in 2025 multiple expansion a higher PE ratio or good oldfashioned earnings growth If Alphabets PE ratio rises to 433 it would translate to a 68 increase in its stock price from where it currently trades That alone would make it a 4 trillion company without any additional earnings growth Even if Alphabets PE ratio rose to 35 equivalent to Microsoft the cheapest 3 trillion stock its market cap would jump to 32 trillion But what if its PE ratio remained the same and the company relied on earnings growth alone Wall Streets consensus forecast provided by Yahoo Finance suggests Alphabet will generate 899 in EPS this year which places its stock at a forward PE ratio of 216 It implies the stock will have to climb by 19 before the end of the year just to maintain its current PE ratio of 257 which would be enough to lift its market cap to 285 trillion So it still needs some multiple expansion In 2020 the US Department of Justice DOJ sued Alphabet for engaging in anticompetitive behavior The lawsuit referenced the large payments Alphabet makes every year to partners including Apple in exchange for making Google the default search engine on devices like the iPhone In August 2024 the judge ruled in the DOJs favor which left Alphabet in an uncertain position The court wont define Alphabets punishment until later this year It could impose a financial penalty which would be a positive for shareholders or it could force the company to stop paying partners like Apple which would erode Googles market share The DOJ actually wants Alphabet to sell its Chrome internet browser which uses Google by default to help restore some competitiveness to the search industry If any of the more severe remedies are imposed this case could be tied up in the courts for years as Alphabet appeals the decision However the DOJ is likely to be overhauled once the Trump administration takes office on Jan 20 Trump is expected to bring a businessfriendly policy agenda to the White House which includes significant deregulation He even made some specific comments on the campaign trail last year that suggested he doesnt want to see Alphabets business broken up Personally I think the odds of a financial settlement are now extremely high which will be a massive win for the company If the Trump administration pulls Alphabet out of the regulatory fire its PE ratio is likely to jump several points as investors cheer the removal of a significant risk Combined with the companys projected earnings growth I think it has a great shot at joining the 3 trillion club in 2025 Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most

when there are often many factors at play Fortune spoke with several career experts to get to the bottom of the typical employee red flags that could put a worker in danger of being fired under this style of workforce reduction They spell out a few surefire misstepsfrom falling short on KPIs and being disengaged to being critical of others Luckily so many of these factors are avoidable through selfevaluation and open and clear communication with management Gabrielle Davis career expert at Indeed tells Fortune Employees who strive to be reliable valuedriven adaptable and positive influences in the workplace have the best bet of safeguarding their careers during times of uncertainty There are several negative behaviors that will put an employee on the chopping block according to career experts One of the most obvious is not hitting the performance goals set out by an employer There are certain red flags or mistakes that can increase the likelihood of an employee being let go Davis says Consistent underperformance and missed KPIs a lack of effort or engagement resistance to change or inadaptability or poor collaboration can all have the potential to put an employee at risk By now many workers understand that falling short on their KPIs can lead to performance improvement plans or being fired However some may not recognize other patterns of behavior that stand out to employers for the wrong reasons Keith Spencer career expert at ResumeNow tells Fortune that there are in fact many other mistakes that can lead to termination Common pitfalls to avoid include missing deadlines delivering subpar work resisting change being openly critical of others refusing to adopt new tools or processes ignoring feedback and being unclear unresponsive or inconsistent in your communication he says Spencer points out another misstep that employees may overlook not promoting your achievements Failing to advocate for yourself and share your successes can also cause your

signs of becoming a breakthrough technology That said AI still appears to be in the early innings with 2025 still promising a lot of opportunities in the sector Lets look at three AI stocks to buy this month Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA has arguably been the biggest winner from AI as its revenue absolutely skyrocketed the past two years In fiscal year 2024 ended in January of last year its revenue grew 125 while in fiscal year 2025 its revenue is set to more than double once again The companys graphic processing units GPUs are the backbone of the AI infrastructure buildout due to GPUs impressive processing speed which is needed to handle large language model LLM training and AI inference Meanwhile it amassed a whopping 90 market share in the GPU space over rival Advanced Micro Devices due to its superior software platform CUDA which includes developer tools and microlibraries that easily allow its chips to be programmed to handle various AIrelated tasks Spending on AI infrastructure only continues to accelerate as LLMs need more and more computing power to be trained on Meanwhile Nvidias largest customer Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT announced it would spend around 80 billion this calendar year on AI data centers Typically about half that spending goes toward servers with GPUs By comparison for its last fiscal year ended in June Microsoft spent 445 billion in capital expenditures capex With other large customers also ramping up capex spending on AI infrastructure this year Nvidia still has a lot of growth ahead Despite its strong stock performance Nvidia trades at a forward pricetoearnings ratio PE of about 315 based on 2025 analyst estimates and a priceearningstogrowth ratio PEG of 098 A PEG under 1 is generally view as undervalued and growth stocks will often trade with PEGs well above 1 Microsoft is planning to spend big on AI infrastructure this year and for good reason The companys cloud computing unit Azure has been a big AI winner showing revenue growth of 33 last quarter while its Azure OpenAI usage doubled in the past six months Azure is a consumption model and customers are using its services to help built out their own AI agents and applications This is also leading to more usage of its data and analytics services While Azure has been showing strong growth it could be even more robust if not for capacity constraints It has already forecast that Azure revenue will begin to accelerate in the second half of its fiscal year as more capacity comes on from past capex spending Meanwhile it is pouring a ton of money into building out data centers across the world to try and keep up with demand In addition to cloud computing the company also has a big opportunity on the AI software side with its AI assistant copilots for its Microsoft 365 suite of productivity tools For 30 a month per enterprise use Microsoft provides AI copilots for its variety of productivity tools that can do such things as organize and prioritize emails create PowerPoint presentations using only natural language and even use the Python programming language in Excel using only natural language prompts These AI copilots can save workers a lot of time and should be a big growth driver for the company moving forward Trading at a PE of 325 current fiscal year estimates the stock is reasonably valued Salesforce NYSE CRM is looking to become the leader in agentic AI which is believed to be the next evolution of AI beyond generative AI With generative AI users can create content via a prompt such as asking ChatGPT to create a vacation itinerary Agentic AI would take that to the next level by going out on its own and booking everything needed for that vacation such as flights hotels dinner reservations and tour guides Long the leader in customer relationship management CRM software the company launched its agentic AI platform Agentforce in October with an improved version announced in midDecember The platform offers a variety of outofthebox agents that users can customize through its nocode and lowcode tools while customers will be able to build their own agents from scratch as well Outofthebox agents are available in such areas as sales marketing recruiting and customer service among others Salesforce has seen early rapid adoption of Agentforce with the company saying in early December that it had closed 200 teams while in midDecember it said it had closed more than 1000 It has projected it will have 1 billion Agentforce AI agents deployed by the end of its fiscal 2026 ending January 2026 Agentforce is a consumption product that costs 2 per conversation so this is a big opportunity moving forward for the company The stock currently trades at a reasonable value of 29 times fiscal 2026 earnings and a PEG of 08

Palantir PLTR and Amazon as three winners under the incoming administration Tesla is a leader in the EV world and I think the new administration will be favorable to them Tigay said And theres big money to be had specifically in the cloud services In a new administration tariffs around the world are going to be costly for a lot of companies but Amazons infrastructure is so diverse that they can find places where tariffs are less impactful and be able to capture some of that gain for its consumers Tigay also noted that Palantirs focus on cost reduction and AI adoption uniquely aligns with the priorities of a second Trump administration IBM IBM CEO Arvind Krishna told me at Yahoo Finances Invest conference that hes hopeful the incoming Trump administration will foster a lot more innovation and less regulation laying the groundwork for a more favorable deal environment If we have more certainty on the outcome then we are willing to lean into things like MA If the regulatory process and antitrust are going to be more certain that allows you to take more risk Krishna said But its important to point out that not all tech and not even all of the Magnificent Seven names are expected to be winners Analysts warn tariff risks coupled with a sluggish Chinese market could spell trouble for Apple AAPL the second biggest contributor to the SP last year behind Nvidia and other hardware

Dan Ives is one of the most closely followed personalities on Wall Street Ives leads global technology research for Wedbush Securities and can often be found touting bullish narratives and forecasts about artificial intelligence AI on financial media outlets such as CNBC or Bloomberg In late December Ives took to social media platform X formerly Twitter to highlight his top 10 AI picks for 2025 Below Im going to explore three of his software picks and assess if now looks like a good opportunity to scoop up shares It should come as no surprise that Palantir Technologies NASDAQ PLTR earned a position on Ives list of top ideas The primary tailwind fueling Palantir boils down to one thing the companys newest software suite dubbed the Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform AIP Since launching in April 2023 AIP has helped Palantir make a splash in the private sector and remain a competitive option alongside many other data analytics tools flooding the software market Moreover AIP has also helped Palantir form a number of strategic alliances with big tech and consulting firms including Oracle Meta Platforms Microsoft Amazon and Booz Allen Hamilton Many of these partnerships are focused specifically on integrating AIP across cloud infrastructures within the Department of Defense DOD and other militaryrelated agencies In turn Palantir has unlocked new ways to accelerate its historically lumpy government business While I am personally bullish on Palantirs longterm potential I must also admit that the stock has gotten overwhelmingly expensive Last year Palantir was the topperforming stock in the SP 500 index SNPINDEX GSPC after the companys shares soared 340 Although I think 2025 should be another terrific year for Palantir Id caution investors against buying into the stock during a pronounced period of momentum The next company Ill be exploring is Salesforce NYSE CRM While Salesforce is primarily known for its sales and marketing tools the company also owns and operates several other platforms that span across areas such as data analytics and workplace productivity Over the last couple of years large language models LLMs and machine learning have garnered a lot of the chatter surrounding AI However during the companys latest earnings call Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff made it clear that the companys next growth wave revolves around agentic AI Agentic AI will utilize generative AI protocols such as LLMs and machine learning applications but will not require a human to operate as these digital agents become smarter and more independent over time Salesforces agentic AI platform is aptly called Agentforce and right now its already being used by some of the worlds largest enterprises including IBM FedEx and Accenture At the moment Microsofts CoPilot is the most mainstream agentic AI offering on the market Given the limited competition and increasing spending on AI infrastructure Im bullish on Salesforces ability to acquire incremental market share in the agentic AI space and think the company has robust prospects ahead Data infrastructure company Snowflake NYSE SNOW went public around the same time as Palantir back in 2020 Yet unlike Palantir investors cheered on Snowflakes public debut in historic fashion Moreover when AI began to emerge as the next megatrend back in late 2022 it was natural to think that Snowflake would be an obvious beneficiary However reality clashed with lofty expectations and eventually investors began to question if the narrative surrounding Snowflake was rooted in hype Ultimately poor investor sentiment around Snowflake resulted in Frank Slootman resigning as the CEO leaving the company with very little to say about its AI chops and if the technology would ever become a core focus in the business While the last year has been a tough one for Snowflake the company is gradually beginning to turn things around Product revenue is growing 29 year over year and the company boasts an astounding net revenue retention NRR rate of 127 indicating that customers are not only remaining on the Snowflake platform but also spending more According to the companys CFO Mike Scarpelli Snowflakes core AI platform Cortex is still very much in the early innings The way I interpret Snowflakes current situation is that the company has been able to improve key performance indicators without AI being a major contributor yet To me this implies that as AI becomes more of a selling point for Snowflake the companys financial profile should continue to strengthen Although Snowflake is not yet out of the woods I am cautiously optimistic about an investment in the stock Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies consider this The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team

traditional GPUs although theyre similar in nature The latest Gaudi 3 chip offers solid performance and Intel has been aggressive on pricing Gaudi could have been a success story for Intel but an immature software ecosystem is hurting sales Developers who have been working with GPUs for years dont have experience with Gaudis distinct architecture something thats been impossible for Intel to overcome Software immaturity is starting to become a theme for Intel in the graphics and AI spaces In 2023 the company tried again in the discrete GPU market with its Arc Alchemist gaming graphics cards but they failed to sell well due to faulty software drivers and myriad gamebreaking bugs The company has stuck with it greatly improving its software over time and its secondgeneration graphics cards are faring much better If Intels experience in the graphics card business is any indication its going to take time for the AI software ecosystem to improve enough for Gaudi to be a major success Another wrinkle is that Intels AI accelerator roadmap is complicated Under the Max brand name Intel already sells data center GPUs which power the Aurora supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory Neither the Max family of GPUs nor the Gaudi family of AI accelerators will be extended Rather the nextgeneration Falcon Shores will be a traditional GPU that will reportedly integrate some of Gaudis unique features Falcon Shores is expected to launch by the end of 2025 although there are no guarantees given Intels current turmoil Gaudi 3 sales should ramp up this year compared to last year but given the software issues sales are unlikely to be anywhere close to what AMD is raking in with its data center GPUs Intel has had some successes although theyve been few and far between One major win was a deal with IBM to put Gaudi 3 chips in IBMs cloud data centers and integrate them into IBMs watsonx AI platform That should help boost Gaudi sales this year although the size of the deal hasnt been disclosed Intel may eventually find success selling data center GPUs that double as AI accelerators but its probably not going to happen this year In the long run manufacturing AI accelerators for other companies may prove to be a more lucrative endeavor Intel is betting big on leveraging its decades of manufacturing expertise and tens of billions of dollars in manufacturing investments to build a viable foundry business The company is on the cusp of completing its initial process roadmap with the Intel 18A process scheduled to go into volume production next year Intel will make some of its own central processing units CPUs on Intel 18A and its already won a few highprofile customers Those customers include Microsoft which will use Intel 18A to produce an undisclosed chip and Amazon which will tap Intel 18A for an AI fabric chip If Intel can prove to potential customers that Intel 18A is the real deal by successfully making its own chips and making chips as part of these early partnerships more AIrelated chips could be running through Intels foundries in 2026 and beyond Long story short Intels AI accelerator revenue probably wont be all that impressive in 2025 as the company works through software issues and solidifies its roadmap However looking further ahead the foundry business may ultimately be a larger opportunity for Intel to scoop up some AI spending Ever

index for a small portion of the year But it was still by far the bestperforming Dow stock in 2024 with a 1712 return walloping secondplace Walmarts 719 gain and thirdplace American Express 584 Nvidia stock went up a mindnumbing 8189 between 2023 and 2024 which may lead some investors to question how much further it can run before its valuation gets stretched too thin Heres why the rally in Nvidia stock is somewhat justified why Nvidia could continue outperforming the market and is worth buying and some reasons to keep Nvidia on a watchlist for now Nvidia followed up a riproaring 2023 with another incredible year in 2024 briefly becoming the most valuable company in the world before Apple reclaimed the title Nvidia has defended its commanding lead in the graphics processing unit GPU market despite a slew of competition In December Nvidia announced that its Blackwell architecture for generative artificial intelligence AI was coming to Amazon Web Services On Jan 3 Microsoft said it plans to spend 80 billion in its current fiscal year to build out AIenabled datacenters to train AI models and deploy AI and cloudbased applications around the world On Jan 7 Amazon said it plans to spend 11 billion in the US state of Georgia alone on AI infrastructure and cloud technologies Nvidia could easily beat the market again in 2025 because it continues to innovate and AI spending is showing no signs of slowing down Nvidia rallied to an alltime high on Monday in response to news that Nvidia customer Hon Hai Precision Industry also known as Foxconn is seeing massive growth for AI in cloud and networking The rally could have also been driven by anticipation of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang giving the keynote address at CES a major technology conference in Las Vegas However Nvidia pulled back 62 on Tuesday after Huangs keynote Nvidia will report its fourthquarter and fullyear fiscal 2025 results on Feb 26 Analyst consensus estimates call for 295 in fiscal 2025 earnings per share and 443 in fiscal 2026 earnings per share implying yearoveryear growth of 50 So its worth understanding that there are lofty expectations already baked into Nvidias forward pricetoearnings PE ratio of 506 Nvidia is by no means a cheap stock based on nearterm expectations But it could grow into its valuation over time if it continues innovating and sees sustained product demand No force is more powerful in the stock market than earnings growth Earnings growth can justify a premium valuation and make a stock quickly look cheap For example if Nvidia stock returns 20 per year over the next five years but averages 30 earnings growth in that period its forward PE will decline from its current level of around 51 to under 30 This lesson demonstrates why excellent earnings growth can make expensive stocks look like a good value for longterm investors As long as Nvidia continues on its path it should have no problem outperforming the SP 500 SNPINDEX GSPC However if theres a major industrywide slowdown or competition heats up it wouldnt be surprising to see Nvidia sell off Nvidia has been at the forefront of a rapidly growing industry Earnings are soaring and so is the stock price But for earnings to keep going up Nvidia has to lap its difficult comps That could become challenging if the investment cycle enters a slowdown or less expensive alternatives like chips made by Advanced Micro Devices eat away at some of Nvidias market share The buy case for Nvidia is quite simple If you believe the company will remain a longterm winner in AI the stock is worth buying and holding But its worth understanding that Nvidias skyhigh operating margins market share and growth rate may not be sustainable over the long term Even if revenue growth remains strong Nvidias earnings growth could fall if its margins come down Nvidias trailing 12month gross margin is 759 and its operating margin is 627 meaning its converting the majority of sales into operating income a truly unbelievable feat Nvidias high profitability comes from the ability to set premium prices for its products which deeppocketed customers willingly pay to further their AI ambitions If those customers arent able to monetize AI as well as they hoped they could slow their pace of AI spending which would affect Nvidia even if it continues cranking out great products Put another way Nvidia needs to continue making great products and its customers must be able to afford those products For example companies can spend money on Nvidia computing hardware for selfdriving vehicles but those vehicles must sell to justify future order volumes Just as the buy case for Nvidia is fairly straightforward I think the reasons to keep it on a watchlist are also simple Some investors may prefer to take a waitandsee approach to how Nvidia handles mounting competition how it performs in an industry slowdown and if it can continue to be the undisputed industry leader Nvidia has been at the top of its game uninterrupted for a couple of years now If it keeps it up its easy to see how Nvidia could become the most valuable company in the world and maintain position But its also possible that spending on AI could flatline for a few years or that some unforeseen challenges will appear that hinder Nvidias ability to grow Nvidia is priced for strong and sustained growth but not for perfection Despite the runup it doesnt have a nosebleed valuation Instead of trying to time the market its better to do some research and decide where you stand on Nvidia If you decide not to buy the stock now and keep it on a watchlist its important to have clearly defined reasons for what needs to change to consider buying the stock That way you can ensure you are using business performance as a measuring stick

every year Indeed in Apples last fiscal year it raked in 391 billion in revenue Better still it kept fully 24 of that more than 90 billion as net income So it wont surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world Its actually the biggest company in the world with a recent market value of 368 trillion ahead of Nvidia 354 trillion Microsoft 315 trillion Alphabet 236 trillion and Amazon 236 trillion Despite all that investing in Apple is not a nobrainer move It does require a little brain work because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to Here are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock It has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence AI which may pay off handsomely Some expect that Apple Intelligence which is already incorporated in many products may drive a lot of upgrades Some expect that with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers Apple is a dividendpaying stock Its dividend yield was recently only 041 but that payout has been growing by an average annual rate of about 6 Its currently paying about 099 per share per year up from 076 in 2019 and 051 in 2015 Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares so that its total yield to shareholders including both dividends and buybacks per Morningstar was recently 3 Apple is financially healthy and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth whether via research and development or acquisitions Despite all that theres a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple its valuation Consider these recent metrics Metric Recent FiveYear Average Pricetosales ratio PSR 95 69 Pricetoearnings PE ratio 398 284 Forwardlooking PE ratio 324 268 Pricetocash flow ratio 326 233 Data source Morningstar as of Jan 8 2025 If you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades youll likely make money and potentially a lot of it Nevertheless it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level And if you were to buy at a lower level all your gains would be greater Much depends on your risk tolerance Meanwhile those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years Year Apple Gain or Loss 2024 301 2023 482 2022 268 2021 338 2020 808 2019 862 2018 68 2017 461 2016 100 Data source 1stock1com as of Jan 8 2025 Another reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasnt introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time Granted few companies ever do but Apple has done so multiple times with offerings such as the iPod iPad iPhone Apple Watch and more Whether you should buy sell or hold Apple depends a lot on you Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly Do you think its current price is reasonable a bargain or very overvalued I think its reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80 gains in any future years though it could of course happen Once a company is worth several trillion dollars it can be harder to grow quickly though its still possible If youre tempted but unsure you might buy a small position in Apple or establish a bigger position over time buying shares incrementally Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point I am an Apple shareholder personally and Im planning to remain one for a long time I have however shed some shares over the past year or two in

Theres been a lot of ink spilled about the growing demand for artificial intelligence AI and the potential for the technology to revolutionize the world Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA has been one of the clearest beneficiaries of this trend The companys graphics processing units GPUs cornered the market by providing the computational horsepower needed to fuel the technology Yet Nvidias stock price has stalled over the past six months Some investors fear the gravy train has run its course and demand for its AI chips could trail off However a growing mountain of evidence provides a crystal clear answer to the question Is it too late to buy Nvidia stock The biggest contributor to Nvidias meteoric rise over the past two years has been the unrivaled performance of its GPUs These chips were originally developed to create lifelike images in video games but are equally adept at providing the computational horsepower needed to support generative AI The sheer volume of data required to train these AI models is daunting and few companies have the resources to develop these toptier models from scratch and nearly all of them are Nvidia customers The final totals for 2024 have yet to be released but Nvidia dominates the market for the data center GPUs used for AI In 2023 much like 2022 Nvidia commanded a 98 market share and its leadership position in the space isnt expected to change any time soon Even as the company has tasked its partners to ramp up production of its highend AI processors demand continues to exceed supply Theres evidence suggesting that unprecedented demand will continue Just last week Microsoft president Brad Smith announced that in fiscal 2025 which began July 1 the company is on track to invest approximately 80 billion to build out AIenabled data centers to train AI models and deploy AI and cloudbased applications He was clear about why he believed this spending was necessary Not since the invention of electricity has the United States had the opportunity it has today to harness new technology In many ways artificial intelligence is the electricity of our age and the next four years can build a foundation for Americas economic success for the next quarter century For context Microsoft spent nearly 56 billion on capital expenditures capex last fiscal year marking a 44 increase in spending This shows that investment to support AI is ramping up rather than slowing down Microsoft isnt the only tech powerhouse spending heavily on AI Alphabet is expected to spend about 51 billion on capex when its books are closed in 2024 and the company plans to ramp up spending next year On the Q3 earnings call CEO Sundar Pichai said Realizing the opportunity of AI requires meaningful capital investment and said there will be substantial increases in capital investment going into 2025 Not to be left out Amazon is expected to spend 75 billion on capex in 2024 and even more in 2025 according to CEO Andy Jassy He went on to say the majority of that will be to support its cloud unit Amazon Web Services AWS and the spending here is really driven by generative AI While it isnt a cloud provider Meta Platforms has been spending heavily to develop its cuttingedge Llama AI models The company was on track to spend roughly 39 billion in 2024 and CFO Susan Li said We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025 She previously stated that this spending was to support our AI research and product development efforts Based on these tech executives comments its clear that spending on AI is ramping up The lions share of that spending will be for the data centers and servers needed to support AI with the principal beneficiary being Nvidia whose chips underpin the technology Nvidia doesnt disclose exactly who its biggest customers are but Wall Street has done some detective work Analysts with Bloomberg and Barclays Research have concluded that Nvidias four biggest customers responsible for 40 of revenue are Microsoft 15 Meta Platforms 13 Amazon 62 Alphabet 58 Executives from each of these companies have been crystal clear about their plans to ramp capex spending the vast majority to support cloud computing and more specifically AI As the unrivaled leader in the data center GPU space Nvidia stands to reap the windfall of all this spending After generating tripledigit yearoveryear growth for five consecutive quarters Nvidias growth eventually slowed but remains impressive nonetheless During its fiscal 2025 third quarter ended Oct 27 Nvidia generated record revenue of 35 billion which surged 94 year over year and 17 sequentially At the same time adjusted earnings per share EPS of 081 soared 103 The days of tripledigit growth have likely passed but many believe Nvidia still has a long runway ahead Despite the runaway success of the companys Hopper AI processor the recently released Blackwell chip is expected to generate even more sales The processor which is in full production and began shipping late last quarter is believed to be sold out for the coming 12 months despite its recent release The mountain of evidence suggests Nvidia has a long road ahead as the adoption of AI gains steam Furthermore even after notching gains of more than 850 over the past two years as of this writing Nvidia stock remains attractively priced selling for roughly 32 times next years expected sales Given its industryleading technology the increasing demand for its processors and the reasonable valuation I would submit that it isnt too late to buy Nvidia particularly given the growing adoption of

last few years Market capitalization the result of multiplying a companys share price by the number of outstanding shares is an imperfect measure of a companys value but its a useful guide Its certainly reflective of a companys dominance in a market and Nvidia has been dominant in artificial intelligence AI Can investors expect this to continue The rollout of Blackwell the newest iteration of Nvidias Superchips is imminent and demand is extremely high The pace of growth of AI training models is staggering and despite Blackwell chips being more than twice as powerful as their predecessors CEO Jensen Huang explained that customers are demanding an even greater number of Blackwells for their data centers He told analysts that current versions of AI models could use a maximum of 100000 of the previous Hopper chips but new models start at 100000 Blackwell chips Thats driving a demand that he referred to as insane Its been reported Nvidia is sold out of Blackwell for at least 12 months even as it attempts to ramp up production partnering with Foxconn to build the worlds largest Blackwell production facility in Mexico Investors will see how this plays out but things look good for the rollout of the companys most important product Its successful launch will drive sales likely leading to another year of growth in the healthy double digits Morgan Stanley analysts believe there could be a 44 gain in topline revenue over the next year Since the AI boom took off the lions share of Nvidias revenue has flowed in from Silicon Valley companies that build and operate the physical data centers that enable AI think Alphabet and Microsoft The latter announced recently that it expects to spend a staggering 80 billion in AI infrastructure in fiscal year 2025 That represents a 60 increase from 2024s roughly 50 billion and is significantly more than the 63 billion some analysts expected Last years spend was already a record amount and significantly more than the year before Look at Microsofts growth in capital expenditures over the last five years the majority of this has come from building AI data centers and buying Nvidia chips This trend isnt leveling off but accelerating and is great news for companies like Nvidia that are downstream of this spending Its also very unlikely that Microsoft will be alone in this If Microsoft expects to grow its AI spending to this degree you can be sure that others around Silicon Valley will follow suit All signs at the moment point to Nvidia continuing to dominate an everexpanding market one that PwC one of the big four accounting firms believes can add 157 trillion to the global economy by 2030 Is Nvidias client base tightening their belts Signs of this are not only absent but also the opposite of whats been happening The massive expansion of AI data center spending by Microsoft is a critically positive sign for Nvidia and its bottom line at least for the next year I believe that Nvidias reign will

Wall Street expect to see the first 4 trillion company sometime in 2025 Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA has seen its value soar amid rampant artificial intelligence AI spending as big tech companies race to build out bigger data centers and train more advanced AI models With big tech planning to spend even more in 2025 its strong results should continue Its market cap climbed from 416 billion the day OpenAI released ChatGPT to 343 trillion as of this writing The only company Nvidia trails in size is Apple NASDAQ AAPL which has long sat at or near the top of the worlds most valuable companies Apples massive iPhone user base has supported a growing services business over the past decade and AI could propel that services business in 2025 as it integrates more advanced capabilities into its iOS and macOS operating systems Its market cap sits at 367 trillion as of this writing Meanwhile Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT is leading in AI on two fronts An early investment in OpenAI gave it the integrations it needed to sell developers on its Azure cloud computing platform Azure sales have accelerated as a result and management expects that trend to continue in 2025 Meanwhile Microsofts leading position in enterprise productivity software and PC operating systems gives it a huge market for its Copilot AI agents which help improve accuracy and worker productivity It has a market cap of 316 trillion as of this writing Any of the above could become the first 4 trillion company in 2025 But one company could leapfrog them on the path to 5 trillion by the end of the decade The big reason for all of the excitement around AI is its ability to transform multiple industries And one company has its hand in several of those industries Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Thats why it could be the first company to reach a 5 trillion valuation Amazon is one of the biggest investors in AI Management said during its thirdquarter earnings call in September that it expected to spend 75 billion on capital expenditures in 2024 The majority of that spending will go toward its cloud computing business Amazon Web Services AWS and other technology infrastructure Some will go toward the continued buildout of its logistics network Amazons spending is absolutely massive but its proven to be well worth the price Even while investing more than any other big tech company its generating record amounts of free cash flow Free cash flow climbed to 477 billion over the trailing 12 months in Q3 more than doubling year over year Those strong financial results are driven by Amazons diverse operations AWS has been a strong driving force AWS sales accelerated in 2024 increasing 19 year over year in Q3 Moreover AWS now has substantial scale which shows up in operating income growth of 49 in Q3 AWS growth is powered by Amazons support for advanced AI development across multiple foundation models It continues to work on more efficient custombuilt AI accelerators for training and inference which give its customers lowercost options compared to Nvidias chips Meanwhile the core of Amazon has always been its ecommerce business Amazon continues to grow its share of ecommerce year after year despite strong competition from bigbox retailers improving their online operations and ultracheap alternatives like Temu and Shein The main reason Amazon has proved so successful at defending and expanding its lead is its Prime membership Prime subscriptions give customers free oneday shipping on millions of items on Amazons marketplace along with various other benefits including Prime Video The growth of Prime is a virtuous cycle whereby more members attract more merchants offering a wider variety of goods in turn attracting more Prime members Amazons subscription services revenue continues to climb at a doubledigit pace despite its high penetration rate among consumers Amazon isnt just standing by and letting the flywheel spin Its actively pushing It overhauled its logistics operations in 2023 to focus on multiple regions throughout the United States It uses advanced algorithms that predict demand and monitor instock levels to ensure items remain in stock across each region The new regionalized network forms the foundation of a burgeoning logistics services business as well Finally Amazons strong position in ecommerce has helped it build a massive digital advertising business Ad sales totaled 536 billion over the trailing 12 months Amazon should be able to sustain that pace as it expands video advertising all Prime memberships include adsupported streaming by default Generative AI has the potential to supercharge ad sales on Amazon especially considering Amazons scale and data which can fuel iterative testing for ad campaigns ensuring better conversions for merchants Amazons business is operated with one key metric in mind longterm freecashflow generation To that end its been a wild success As mentioned free cash flow totaled 477 billion over the last 12 months Thats up from about 1 billion 10 years ago Over the next five years free cash flow could climb even higher AWS fueled by the growth of AI is showing strong improvements in operating income Despite the massive spending to build out new data centers develop its own chips and attract new customers with improvements to the platform growth is outpacing the increased spending Moreover Amazon is currently undergoing a massive investment cycle The 75 billion in expected 2024 capital expenditures is a new record for the company Its likely to increase further in 2025 But eventually that spending will plateau At that point Amazon will reap what its sown across AWS its logistics network and its ecommerce business which fuels its advertising business That cycle has played out multiple times for Amazon over the last 30 years Historically Amazon has traded around 50 times free cash flow At that multiple it would be worth 5 trillion once it produces 100 billion in free cash flow That may happen sooner than investors expect given the strong growth in free cash flow looks poised to continue soaring through the end of the decade Before you buy stock in Amazon consider this The Motley

symbol or a specific company name for relevant results Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media Recently Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025 Unsurprisingly many of his choices are among the Magnificent Seven Below Ill explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist Tesla NASDAQ TSLA is probably the most interesting name on Ives list For much of 2024 shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market But beginning in early November shares started going parabolic All told Tesla stock gained 62 in 2024 nearly triple that of the SP 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite The catalyst that fueled Teslas rebound The outcome of the US presidential election During the final months of Donald Trumps campaign Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate Following Trumps victory in early November Ives made it clear that he sees Musks relationship with the presidentelect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla Specifically Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fasttrack Teslas autonomous driving and robotaxi plans While I think Ives outlook makes sense its important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Teslas share price following the election results Is it really surprising to see Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA listed as a top idea for 2025 Last year Nvidia was the topperforming Magnificent Seven stock with shares climbing 171 and the companys valuation gaining more than 2 trillion Despite this unprecedented move Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling This year Nvidias biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup known as Blackwell With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidias new architecture 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader With a 4 trillion valuation within reach investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business I see Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech Over the last two years the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI the developer of ChatGPT Microsoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon Alphabet and Oracle Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit In addition Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AIs next big megatrends agentic AI The companys agentic AI virtual assistant called CoPilot is used by almost 70 of the Fortune 500 To me Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors While Ives has remained bullish on Apple NASDAQ AAPL for some time I have my concerns According to Ives Apples new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense I question how it will play out in reality Apple was late to the AI game and Im not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones Remember Apples consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury If your old iPhone is still manageable Apples AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a highercost device While Id love to be proven wrong on this one Apple is the one stock on this list that Im hesitant about right now To me Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks Ive explored Similar to Microsoft Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AIpowered services from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools advertising streaming consumer hardware and more Alphabet is an extremely diversified business and the companys revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction Yet despite the companys impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities Alphabet only trades at a forward pricetoearnings PE multiple of 219 thats lower than the average forward PE of the SP 500 I think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok While I understand these concerns in theory I think Alphabets financial results depicted above speak for themselves To me an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for longterm investors to buy the stock hand over fist Ever feel like you missed the

global AI regulation especially in the US the EU and the UK Presidentelect Donald Trump who is supported by business leaders like Elon Musk may influence AI policies with Musks experience in AI raising expectations for US advancements In Europe the EUs AI Act has introduced comprehensive regulations but tensions with US tech companies are still there over its strict measures Meanwhile the UK

McNeill cofounder of Vistashares discussed the impact of AI infrastructure on investment opportunities in an interview with Romaine Bostick and Scarlet Fu of Bloomberg He explained that while AIs impact on data centers is often discussed in terms of semiconductors the actual supply chain involves different elements such as memory cooling and fiber optics McNeill emphasized the potential for profits in the AI supply chain especially for investors looking beyond the major producers to lesserknown companies He also addressed the risks of international investments and noted that while the US dominates the AI sector Asia is rapidly building its own AI infrastructure McNeill highlighted the growing value of AI applications in autonomous driving and robotics which could drive significant economic growth He pointed to large investments in data centers such as AWS 11 billion investment in Georgia as signs that this growth will continue with the major tech companies leading the charge in

valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results Sign in to access your portfolio","Tip Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results The artificial intelligence AI trend has given big boosts to the share prices of Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing NYSE TSM over the past year The two chipmakers stocks rose by 204 and 121 respectively during the period crushing the 35 gains recorded by the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index The massive demand for powerful chips capable of handling AI workloads in data centers has played a central role in driving those share price gains with major cloud service companies and governments deploying large quantities of the AIspecific semiconductors designed by Nvidia and manufactured by Taiwan Semi Market research firm Gartner estimates that global public cloud spending grew by 192 in 2024 and forecasts that it will grow at a faster pace of 215 in 2025 Evidence that cloud spending will get stronger in 2025 has already started emerging In a blog post earlier this month Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Vice Chairman and President Brad Smith said the company is on track to invest approximately 80 billion to build out AIenabled datacenters to train AI models and deploy AI and cloudbased applications around the world This news points toward a solid year for Nvidia and TSMC When Microsoft released its results for its fiscal 2025 first quarter which ended Sept 30 the company revealed that it had made capital expenditures of 149 billion on property plant and equipment As such its plan points toward a higher level of quarterly capex spending around 22 billion on average for the rest of the fiscal year For comparison Microsofts total capital expenditure stood at 557 billion in fiscal 2024 so its capex is on track to increase by more than 43 The tech giant has made it clear that the money will go toward building AI data centers So Microsofts demand for the AI chips that Nvidia designs and TSMC manufactures should continue to rise in 2025 Microsoft however wont be the only company significantly increasing its capital outlays for AI infrastructure Meta Platforms for example is expected to report total 2024 capital expenses in the range of 38 billion to 40 billion but its planning for significant growth on that front in 2025 In all the combined spending of major cloud computing players Microsoft Meta Amazon and Alphabet could reach 300 billion in 2025 from around 200 billion in 2024 according to estimates from Morgan Stanley The addressable market for AI chips is set to expand considerably this year More importantly there is a good chance that both of these semiconductor giants will be able to meet the terrific demand from the major cloud providers Thats because Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently remarked that the tech giant isnt constrained for AI chip supply anymore Thats not surprising During Nvidias November earnings conference call CFO Colette Kress said that in the current fiscal quarter the company is on track to exceed our previous Blackwell revenue estimate of several billion dollars as our visibility into supply continues to increase What this means is that Nvidia is producing more of its nextgeneration Blackwell processors than it was originally anticipating The reason why Nvidia now has greater visibility into its supply chain is because its foundry partner TSMC has been significantly increasing its AI chip production capacity TSMC is expected to double its advanced chip packaging capacity in 2025 to 75000 wafers a month Moreover Nvidia has reportedly been allocated 60 of this increased capacity this year So Nvidia and TSMC are in a solid position to make the most of the impressive increase in capital spending by the major cloud providers discussed above Analysts are expecting Nvidias earnings to increase by 50 in its fiscal 2026 which will begin in February to 443 per share TSMCs earnings on the other hand are expected to jump by 28 in 2025 to 906 per share However the combination of increased capital spending by cloud service providers on AI data centers along with Nvidia and TSMCs focus on quickly adding capacity to serve that high and growing demand should set them up for another year of terrific gains that may surpass Wall Streets current expectations Before you buy stock in Nvidia consider this The

generally accepted definition of cheap stocks You can use that term for those with low share prices for investments that seem to be worth more than Wall Streets asking price and for smallcap companies that might look like affordable buyouts to a larger business You can even apply it to stocks that have fallen far below an earlier pricing peak or to shares with exorbitantly rich dividend yields But some definitions are more useful than others Today Im looking at a couple of tech stocks with the investorfriendly quality of trading at modest valuation ratios despite fantastic longterm prospects This is my favorite definition of cheapness on Wall Street because finding these stocks can make you a lot of money over time You know what they almost say Buy low hold on for many years sell high Getting in at a deepdiscount stock price is a great way to start that moneymaking process So let me show you why I think Roku NASDAQ ROKU and Fiverr International NYSE FVRR fit that description in January 2025 You might recognize these two names as stars of the coronavirus pandemics era of lockdowns and remote work Stuck at home with limited access to other entertainment options millions of people started watching movies and TV shows through streaming media services often via Rokupowered devices Others and in many cases the same people suddenly had time on their hands to pursue online freelancing Fiverr was happy to help with connecting these idle experts in various fields to companies and other people who needed their services So Fiverr and Roku soared in 2020 and 2021 but crashed hard when their customers went back to office work Keep in mind that Im talking about their stocks here not their sales The businesses continued to thrive long after investors started to write them off as temporary COVID19 winners Its true that Fiverr and Roku experienced slower sales growth in 2022 and a brief period of stalled success in 2023 But thats hardly a unique story as consumers around the world changed their spending habits in response to soaring inflation Business powerhouses like Apple and Microsoft were undermined by the same personalbudget effects and with worse results Roku and Fiverr have doubled their annual sales since 2020 while Microsofts topline growth stopped at 66 and Apples was 33 Yet the marketdarling tech giants nearly doubled their stock prices while my freelancing and mediastreaming heroes crashed And Im not worried about Rokus or Fiverrs weak earnings which were often printed in red ink in recent years The companies are still generating healthy free cash flows which makes me think of their low or negative earnings as an effective taxreduction strategy In early 2025 Rokus stock is changing hands at 31 times sales The company is building on its North American market dominance with the beginnings of an international growth strategy and its adbased sales should soon soar again Ad buyers will probably flock to its costeffective ad spots as the aftereffects of the inflation panic are fading out Fiverrs pricetosales ratio sits just below Rokus and the stock is worth just 12 times estimated earnings in 2025 You can also look at its affordable pricetofreecashflow ratio which stops at 145 Based on these metrics Fiverrs stock could double in price and still look cheap next to Microsoft or Apple With expanded operations like a recently launched hub for nonprofit services the company is monetizing its freelancinggig platform in new ways There you have it The future looks bright for these forgotten tech stocks Fiverr and Roku

valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results Shares of retail and cloud computing behemoth Amazon NASDAQ AMZN rallied 444 in 2024 according to data from SP Global Market Intelligence Like most of the Magnificent Seven Amazon had a great 2024 as investors piled into largecap technology stocks participating in the artificial intelligence AI revolution But Amazon had also entered the year with some big questions hanging over it as investors wondered whether it had fallen behind rivals in the AI race Yet over the course of the year Amazon put many of those concerns to rest Coming into 2024 some thought Amazon was caught late to the AI game After all cloud rival Microsoft invested early in OpenAI the company behind ChatGPT which appeared to give Microsoft the early lead in AI cloud workloads But did anyone think Amazon of all companies would take this lying down Since 2023 Amazon has gotten to work on its own AI cloud services First leveraging its size as the largest cloud provider heading into the AI revolution Amazon rolled out its Bedrock cloud services in mid2023 Amazon Bedrock offers a variety of competing thirdparty large language models for developers giving perhaps the most diversified AI tool portfolio of any cloud provider Additionally in late 2023 Amazon invested in OpenAI rival Anthropic which is run by OpenAIs exvice president of research Dario Amodei and is available on Bedrock Amazon then followed up that initial investment with two more investments in Anthropic in 2024 Amazons latest investment in November amounted to 4 billion bringing its total investment in Anthropic to 8 billion In conjunction with that investment Anthropic agreed to use AWS as its primary cloud provider and training partner while also committing to use Amazons Trainium and Inferentia chips to train and run its future AI models The collaboration appeared to both validate Anthropic as a key player in the AI races and a serious OpenAI competitor while also validating Amazons inhouse chips as worthy tools against the current AI training standard of expensive Nvidia GPUs But it wasnt just press releases and investments that drove Amazon higher positive financial results did too AWS revenue growth accelerated 19 in the third quarter up from 12 a year earlier And perhaps just as important the segments operating margin expanded from 303 to 381 over that same period Not to be outdone or forgotten Amazons ecommerce segment also picked up the pace and expanded margins too Amazons North America and International ecommerce empires continued their solid growth in the highsingledigits and lowdoubledigits respectively Meanwhile North America ecommerce operating margins expanded by a full percentage point from 49 to 59 while the International business expanded margins from 03 to a positive 36 margin over the past year Amazon spent the past couple of years cutting costs and transitioning to a regional delivery system in its ecommerce business and this years rapid margin expansion appears to show those efforts paying off Amazon has demonstrated resilience in the face of several bear markets and recessions over its corporate life After a difficult postpandemic slowdown the past years improvements show Amazons management culture to be as smart and resilient as its ever been even following the 2021 retirement of founder Jeff Bezos While the stock cant be considered cheap at 35 times this years earnings expectations Amazon has always appeared expensive to many as it has long prioritized longterm thinking over shortterm profits That being said the companys ability to expand profit margins this year after the rapid rise in interest rates since 2022 speaks volumes about Amazons dynamism With this commitment to both innovation and longterm returns on investments Amazon remains a solid core holding for any investor with a longerterm investment horizon beyond five years Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying

optimism about the market despite headwinds Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester wrote in a statement While overall the global market has boomed growing by a quarter over the year the regional disparities have also grown Europes market has shrunk 3 and Chinas has grown by 40 Incentives such as government tradein programs and the product prowess of BYD 1211HK which had over 40 models on sale

approximate growth per Rho Motion Meanwhile Europe saw sales drop 3 in 2024 though regionally there are differences with Rho noting that the UK saw growth with 400000 units sold while Germany reversed lower Lester added that what is clear is that government carrots and sticks are working In North America the 9 growth can mostly be attributed to consumer subsidies and over in the UK the ZEV zero emission vehicle mandate has highly incentivized manufacturers to push their low emission cars Lester said Meanwhile the removal of subsidies in Germany had a devastating impact on the whole European market if the US follows suit we may see the same there Rho predicted the EV market in the US will be tested in 2025 by the incoming Trump administrations threat of reversing the EPA emission

Americans are going to lose access to TikTok in less than a week unless China greenlights a sale to what Congress has deemed a nonadversary of the United States something China is unlikely to do but might In theory There are a few scenarios floating around as we barrel toward the January 19 deadline including one that would hand control of TikToks US operations to your weird uncles favorite MAGA oligarch Elon Musk See here Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese officials are weighing a scenario in which TikToks Beijingbased parent company ByteDance would spin off the apps US operations to Musk an investor they already know and who has already made a mark on the social media world by gutting one of the most influential sites ever created To be clear CNN couldnt independently confirm Bloomberg or the Journals reporting TikTok batted down the speculation and ByteDance has previously said the app is not for sale But such a tieup could make sense at least on paper for a few reasons Musk and by extension Presidentelect Donald Trump gets to play the hero to a whole generation of young social media users At least until he Muskifies the platform the way he did with Twitter more on that in a moment China would be able to put TikToks US operations likely not including the companys allimportant proprietary algorithm in the hands of someone its government already has leverage over Roughly 40 of Teslas EV sales come from Chinese consumers It could be a way to pull X out of the gutter In short TikTok is cool X is not X is hemorrhaging users and advertisers while TikTok is expanding rapidly Analytics firm Emarketer said it expects TikTok to bring in 1553 billion this year in the US alone a 26 jump year over year TikTok fans would be wise to keep the Champagne on ice however It is far from clear whether Musk would be able to strike a deal that satisfies all stakeholders by Congress deadline or whether such a sale could overcome regulatory hurdles Emarketer senior analyst Minda Smiley wrote in an email Tuesday Even if a deal were to happen its likely that a Muskian TikTok wouldnt be the same TikTok we know today TikTok would likely look much different under Musk just look at Twitters drastic transformation to X under his control Smiley wrote And considering TikToks algorithm is unlikely to be part of any sale the app will likely look much different regardless of who owns it should a deal go through TikTok creators many of whom have built their livelihood on the app desperately want to keep the lights on But so far there isnt a widely agreed upon alternative Many are migrating to other Chineseowned apps Lemon8 which is also owned by ByteDance and RedNote an Instagramlike app thats popular in China Some are migrating to Instagram Reels the TikTok knockoff that Meta launched as a competitor in 2020 though many TikTok purists treat that option as a nonstarter Id rather move to China than Instagram Reels is a common sentiment on the platform lately While Reels and TikTok may look similar the user experience and community vibes are wildly different TikTok users tend to look down their nose at Reels because it tends to be a dumping ground for recycled videos that have already come and gone on TikTok for a start The comments section is another area where TikTok culture stands apart users tend to take pride in posting funny or insightful comments which often take on a life of their own Creators on TikTok describe their experience with comments on Reels as banal at best and straightup mean at worst TikTok users tend to value humor and originality while discouraging trolls That could change under a Muskrun TikTok thats merged with X a site thats become a haven for people who think theyre smarter and funnier than they are Meanwhile Tesla investors may not be thrilled about Musk absorbing yet another social media platform after he shelled out 44 billion on X more than two years ago Musk is a busy guy the father of at least 11 children the CEO or owner of at least six companies a constant presence at Presidentelect Donald Trumps MaraLago transition office and the cohead of a toothless advisory on government efficiency But the job thats made him the worlds wealthiest person is running Tesla the only publicly traded company Musk owns I asked Dan Ives a Wedbush Securities analyst and longtime Tesla bull whether the TikTok prospect would rattle investors whove already expressed concerns about the CEOs extracurricular activities Ives noted that while there are clearly risks acquiring TikTok could double Xs value which has cratered by an estimated 80 since Musk took the company private And despite the risks Ives said the bromance between Musk and Trump is a major win for Musk as tech

have some say over whether and how TikToks US assets could be sold to an American buyer are discussing a possible option that involves selling at least a portion of the US version of the app to Musks X according to reports from Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal CNN has not independently confirmed the discussions The discussions would mark a stark reversal in Chinas stance on a TikTok sale just days before the law that could ban the app in the United States is set to go into effect To avoid a ban the law would permit TikToks parent company ByteDance to sell to a USbased owner The reports come after the Supreme Court last week indicated that it would uphold the law over national security concerns despite TikToks argument that it represents an illegal crackdown on free speech Chinas commerce ministry previously said it would firmly oppose a forced sale of TikTok although other wouldbe buyers put up their hands TikTok parent company ByteDance has also previously indicated that the app is not for sale ByteDance and Musk did not respond to requests for comment about the reports And TikTok batted them down spokesperson Michael Hughes told CNN that we cant be expected to comment on pure fiction Still there are logical reasons why Musk ByteDance and China might all find it in their best interests to facilitate a sale of TikToks assets to the X owner ByteDance may simply want to earn something for the US version of TikTok before it loses access to the valuable American market For China selling to Musk could mean placing TikTok in the hands of an ally someone whose business empire is deeply reliant on the Chinese market and who has the ear of incoming President Trump at a time when China will be looking for leverage in tariff negotiations For Musk acquiring TikTok and preserving Americans access to the app at the last second after TikTok fought the ban on First Amendment grounds would play directly into the billionaires often hypocritical image of himself as a defender of free speech It would give him control over an even larger and more influential social media platform than X which he has already successfully used to boost his own interests including aiding the reelection of Donald Trump And Musk already has a team however small it might be at X familiar with managing a social media algorithm and ad sales We might be hearing rumblings about it now to see how people feel about it My bet is that its a float by either Musk or the Chinese to see the reaction James Andrew Lewis director of the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in an email to CNN The Chinese probably are figuring out where it would fit into a larger deal with Trump bit I cant see them giving it away for free But such a deal could still face real hurdles including Musk securing the cash to buy an app in a deal that could cost 40 billion to 50 billion according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives ByteDance is expected to need the Chinese governments signoff to sell TikToks US operations because of export restrictions that could prohibit the sale of sensitive technology such as the apps recommendation algorithm without a license And if the companys legal challenge to the Supreme Court fails Musk may be seen as the most Chinafriendly American buyer given the significant amount of business he does in the country China is Teslas secondlargest market in the third quarter of 2024 alone Tesla earned 57 billion in revenue from China Teslas Shanghai Gigafactory which Musk has praised as building the companys highest quality cars is also among the companys most productive plants And the company is also in the process of building a massive battery factory in Shanghai Musk has held multiple meetings with Chinese officials in recent years including a conversation with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing last April during which the official praised Tesla as a successful model for USChina collaboration Tesla is willing to further deepen cooperation with China and achieve more winwin results Musk told Li during the meeting Although Musk has portrayed himself as a crusader for free speech in the United States he has stayed relatively mute on the topic when it comes to China which has arrested political rivals to Chinese leader Xi Jinping on an unprecedented scale since Xi took power in 2012 Musk has also referred to Taiwan as an integral part of China infuriating Taiwanese leadership One of the biggest investors in China from an infrastructure standpoint is Tesla so Musks relationship within Beijing outside of Tim Cook from Apple is probably the strongest of any US business person Ives told CNN Still Ives said China is unlikely to allow the sale of TikTok with its algorithm which he called the popular apps key DNA China may also want to use Musk to get to Trump A TikTok deal could serve as leverage in negotiations with the incoming administration to avert the massive tariffs the presidentelect has threatened to impose on goods imported from the country which could cause major companies manufacture fewer goods there After donating to Trumps reelection campaign Musk has become one of his closest advisers and has reportedly joined calls between the incoming president and other world leaders And if Trump gives his blessing the incoming president could also use the deal to claim he kept his promise to save TikTok for Americans The TikTok banorsale law gives the president the discretion to decide whether a socalled qualified divestiture of the app has indeed taken place to allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States Musks significant financial resources established business ties in China through Tesla and prominence in the social media industry via X make him a potential candidate for brokering a deal acceptable to multiple stakeholders Dimitar Gueorguiev a Syracuse University associate professor of political science said in emailed commentary For Musk and X the TikTok acquisition could be a golden asset pickup Ives said TikToks 170 million monthly American users would be a big boost to Musks social media company And their videos could also provide beneficial training data for Musks artificial intelligence company xAI A big question overhanging any discussions of a Musk TikTok purchase is likely to be how hed afford it Although Musk is among the richest people in the world much of his wealth is tied up in shares of Tesla and his other companies And after his moneylosing acquisition of X formerly Twitter more than two years ago Musk could have a harder time finding financing partners for a TikTok bid although the shortform video app almost certainly has a more lucrative ad business than X Musks 44 billion purchase of Twitter was always overpriced and the billionaires subsequent decisions after the purchase further tanked the social media companys value That has reportedly left the banks that lent him the money to buy Twitter unable to offload the debt without losing money leaving them with big stains on their balance sheets There are limits to how Musk can use the 170 billion in Tesla shares that he owns outright as collateral for loans too Still banks may be interested in working with Trumps first buddy whose other companies are also expected to benefit from his connection to the White House Musks net worth has soared since the election Even if Musk managed to buy the app theres no saying whether TikTok users would stick around under a new owner Many frustrated users fled X after Musks takeover as he changed its recommendation algorithm did away with the companys trust and safety team and restored previously banned accounts including White supremacists leading to an uptick in hate speech and misinformation Musk himself has also boosted racist conspiracy theories on the app Some TikTok users responded to reports of Musks possible acquisition with excitement including one user who posted a dance video celebrating the news The idea of TikTok going away is scary But you know whats scarier Elon Musk owning it a user named Omie said in a video Tuesday I would rather this app be banned than that mothertrucker own it I mean honestly the idea of this turning into a Twitter is scary Another user who goes by Mo said in a video I love TikTok bro but why does it have to be Elon Musk Hes already running Twitter in to the ground One commenter said on that video I rather China have my info than Elon And TikTok user Dash Dobrofsky said in a video with the caption Oh dear god please no that Musk buying TikTok sounds like a terrible idea This would no doubt make Elon Musk the most powerful man in the world Such a user revolt could ultimately undermine the value of the platform for Musk and any investors hed be able to round up for a TikTok purchase For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNNcom Sign in to access your portfolio","Tip Try a valid symbol or a specific company

data The stock also received support from a bullish call by a Wall Street analyst Tesla shares pared some of the early gains with the stock trading higher by 2 as of 222 pm ET In a recent report Morgan Stanley analysts raised Teslas price target from 400 to 430 per share They also offered a bull case scenario on which the firm applies a price target of 800 for Tesla based on its robotaxi potential Another catalyst today came from a report from EV research firm Rho Motion The firm reported that December marked the fourth consecutive global monthly record of passenger car and lightduty EV sales Importantly it said that all major regions showed monthly sequential and yearoveryear growth in December It marked a new monthly record with over 19 million EVs sold a 5 increase over the prior record That includes battery electric as well as plugin hybrid models That momentum bodes well for Tesla the global EV leader But it wont get the stock price to 800 alone Morgan Stanley lead analyst Adam Jonas does see a path to that level though as he emphasized the increasingly important role of artificial intelligence AI in Teslas plans A fully autonomous robotaxi network is what Jonas sees as potentially pushing the stock to his bull case price target While investors shouldnt expect the stock to jump to the potential 800 price they should monitor Teslas progress using data collection and AI to launch a full selfdriving software package If it does offer that software to Tesla owners an autonomous fleet of highly profitable robotaxis might not be far behind When our

important AI news and ratings on investors radar On Monday the US government revealed that it would further restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports As reported by Reuters the goal behind these restrictions is to help the US advance its computing power and AI technology while finding more ways to block Chinas access Under the new regulations the number of AI chips exported to most countries will be capped allowing unlimited access to US AI technology for Americas closest allies Meanwhile a block shall be maintained on exports to China Russia Iran and North Korea The US leads AI now both AI development and AI chip design and its critical that we keep it that way READ NOW Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Streets Radar and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings These regulations are seemingly the last efforts by the Biden administration to maintain US leadership in AI and close any loopholes in controlling the flow of AI chips The new administration set to take office on January 20 shares similar views on the competitive threat from China However Presidentelect Donald Trump is expected to make significant changes to the Biden administrations stance on artificial intelligence We will repeal Joe Bidens dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI innovation and imposes radical leftwing ideas on the development of this technology In its place Republicans support AI development rooted in free speech and human flourishing With only a few days left until Trump takes office the recently revealed restrictions on AI chips have been imposed on advanced graphics processing units GPUs which are used to power data centers needed to train AI models Moreover under the new rules cloud providers will be able to build data centers by applying for global approval Once approved they wont need export licenses for AI chips which will allow them to build data centers in countries that cannot import enough chips because of the USimposed quotas However these authorized companies must abide by stringent conditions and restrictions such as security requirements reporting demands and a plan or track record of respecting human rights Currently the recent regulation divides the world into three tiers 18 countries including Japan Britain South Korea and the Netherlands will essentially be exempt from the rules Moreover 120 other countries including Singapore Israel Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will face country caps whereas armsembargoed countries like Russia China and Iran will not be allowed to receive the technology altogether How effective the rule ends up being in the next 10 to 15 years is now up to the incoming team They are well aware that ensuring a dominant domestic industry is a core element of

operations of TikTok if the company fails to fend off a controversial ban on the shortvideo app according to people familiar with the matter Most Read from Bloomberg These Homes Withstood the LA Fires Architects Explain Why As EBikes Boom in NYC Some Call for More Regulations A Blueprint for Better Bike Lanes Beijing officials strongly prefer that TikTok remains under the ownership of parent ByteDance Ltd the people say and the company is contesting the impending ban with an appeal to the US Supreme Court But the justices signaled during arguments on Jan 10 that they are likely to uphold the law Senior Chinese officials had already begun to debate contingency plans for TikTok as part of an expansive discussion on how to work with Donald Trumps administration one of which involves Musk said the people asking not to be identified revealing confidential discussions A potential highprofile deal with one of Trumps closest allies holds some appeal for the Chinese government which is expected to have some say over whether TikTok is ultimately sold said the people Musk spent more than 250 million supporting Trumps reelection and has been tapped for a prominent role in improving government efficiency after the Republican takes office Under one scenario thats been discussed by the Chinese government Musks X the former Twitter would take control of TikTok US and run the businesses together the people said With more than 170 million users in the US TikTok could bolster Xs efforts to attract advertisers Musk also founded a separate artificial intelligence company xAI that could benefit from the huge amounts of data generated from TikTok Follow The Big Take daily podcast wherever you listen Chinese officials have yet to reach any firm consensus about how to proceed and their deliberations are still preliminary the people said Its not clear how much ByteDance knows about the Chinese government discussions or whether TikTok and Musk have been involved Its also unclear whether Musk TikTok and ByteDance have held any talks about the terms of any possible deal Musk and his representatives did not respond to a request for comment Musk posted in April that he thinks TikTok should remain available in the US In my opinion TikTok should not be banned in the USA even though such a ban may benefit the X platform he wrote on X Doing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression It is not what America stands for Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun declined to comment on the story during a regular press briefing Tuesday referring reporters to Beijings previous statements on the matter The countrys government had earlier denounced US attempts to ban TikTok and force a sale calling them economic bullying and plundering The Cyberspace Administration of China and Chinas Ministry of Commerce government agencies that could be involved in decisions about TikToks future didnt respond to requests for comment We cant be expected to comment on pure fiction a ByteDance representative said The talks in Beijing suggest that TikToks fate may no longer be in ByteDances sole control said the people Chinese officials recognize they will face tough negotiations with the Trump administration over tariffs export controls and other issues and they see the TikTok negotiations as a potential area for reconciliation they said The Chinese government holds a socalled golden share in a ByteDance affiliate that gives it influence over the companys strategy and operations TikTok maintains that the control only applies to the Chinabased subsidiary Douyin Information Service Co and has no bearing on ByteDance operations outside China Still Beijings export rules prevent Chinese companies from selling their software algorithms like the one integral to TikTok Because the Chinese government would have to approve of a sale that includes TikToks valuable recommendation engine it has a significant voice in any possible deal TikToks US operations could be valued at around 40 billion to 50 billion Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Damian Reimertz estimated last year Thats a substantial sum even for the worlds richest person Its not clear how Musk could pull off such a transaction whether it would require the sale of other holdings or whether the US government would approve He paid 44 billion for Twitter in 2022 and is still paying off sizable loans Musk has a positive reputation among many ByteDance employees in China according to a person familiar with the matter He is seen as a very successful entrepreneur who has experience engaging with the Chinese government through his Tesla Inc business the person added ByteDances leaders have repeatedly said their priority is to fight US legislation that requires the Beijingbased company sell or shut down the US operations because of national security concerns TikToks lawyers have argued the legislation violates free speech laws under the Constitutions First Amendment A majority of the Supreme Court justices suggested the security concerns take priority over free speech although they have yet to issue a formal decision Presidentelect Trump who takes office Jan 20 has sought to delay the TikTok ban which takes effect Jan 19 so he can work on the negotiations He has said he wants to save the app and theres been speculation he could take lastminute action to sidestep the ban On a practical level spinning off TikToks US business would be highly complex affecting shareholders in China as well as the US Lawyers for TikTok argued before the Supreme Court that separating the US portions of the product would be extraordinarily difficult Its unclear if US TikTok would be sold off in a competitive process or if a sale would be arranged by the government Billionaire Frank McCourt and Shark Tank investor Kevin OLeary are part of a bid through Project Liberty to acquire TikTok which OLeary has said he discussed with Trump In the past Microsoft Corp had sought to acquire the business and Oracle Corp has a deep technology partnership with the company One alternative for TikTok would be to move its existing US customers over to a similar app with different branding to potentially sidestep the ban one of the people said Its not clear how effective such a move would be One person close to the company who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the strategy said before the Supreme Court hearing that the legal battle is still the focus of top executives and they would prefer to keep fighting in the US rather than sell TikTok US and cede control for good Musk is in a position to influence the ChinaUS relationship as the worlds richest person with businesses that straddle the worlds two largest economies Tesla where Musk is chief executive officer erected a sprawling factory in Shanghai in 2019 and has since expanded the facility into the companys largest production base The effort helped Tesla expand its market share in China despite tough local competition and build goodwill with government officials While Trump is staffing his incoming administration with China hawks like Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio Musk has spoken out against some recent China trade policies including the Biden administrations tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles The sale of TikTok to Musk could raise anew questions about whether the billionaire is leveraging his relationship with Trump to further his business interests Democrats and government watchdogs have already expressed concern that Musk could seek to roll back regulations on and investigations into Teslas autonomous driving system and head off probes into labor practices at his companies Musk firms hold billions of dollars in government contracts and allies have suggested that the incoming administration could seek to expand government subsidies or contracts for SpaceX and its Starlink satellite network Musk has also faced repeated investigations by the Securities and Exchange Committee Few expect that scrutiny to continue given the close relationship Musk has cultivated with Trump throughout the campaign and transition Since Trumps election Musk has been a mainstay at the presidentelects MaraLago club regularly attending meetings with foreign leaders and potential Cabinet appointments while renting a cottage on the grounds Hes also engaged in policy battles with some of Trumps prominent supporters including a clash over highskill worker visas with more nationalistic factions of his

company name for relevant results Sign in to access your portfolio","Tip Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results There can be a big difference between solving problems in a campaign speech and solving them once youre in office On an array of issues from grocery prices to Ukraine to immigration to the deficit the presidentelect and his close allies already appear to be hedging on clearcut promises that they made again and again and which Donald Trump often said would be simple fixes as complex realities now intervene Perhaps nowhere has the divide been more stark than on the core issue in last years election inflation Specifically prices at the grocery store The doughnuts are going to come down the food is going to come down Trump said in his last campaign rally before the election telling a story of a woman who couldnt afford three apples That should not be happening and we arent going to have it happen long he said But it was a very different message in a Nov 25 interview with Time published last month Its hard to bring things down once theyre up he said of grocery prices discussing challenges like supply chain issues You know its very hard Trumps allies are also pivoting on some of the campaigns promises A key recent example is Elon Musk the cohead of Trumps new extragovernmental Department of Government Efficiency Last fall during a rally in Madison Square Garden the Tesla TSLA CEO pledged to cut at least 2 trillion out of the US governments 6 trillion annual budget It raised eyebrows with budget experts and many others who noted that the entire annual US discretionary budget is just 17 trillion meaning Musk would almost surely need to dip into social safety net programs like Medicare Medicaid and Social Security to accomplish his goals Musk who acknowledged from the start that his effort could lead to temporary hardship has now backtracked In a recent interview with political strategist Mark Penn he said that the 2 trillion figure was a bestcase outcome and that perhaps more realistically he had a good shot at cutting half of that Immigration is another topic where complicated realities appear to be intruding During the campaign Trump again and again promised mass deportations and a reordering of the immigration system That still appears to be coming starting with a wave of immigrationthemed executive orders planned for his first day in office But Trump and his team appear to also be preparing Americans for the fact that they may not feel changes immediately In a recent Meet the Press interview the presidentelect hedged slightly when asked about his promises to deport everyone in the country illegally over his coming term saying Its a very tough thing to do And a recent CNN report outlined how incoming border czar Tom Homan has already been privately tempering Republican lawmaker expectations about the initial deportation operation citing limited resources A third area where Trump is also planning to move fast is energy with a likely wave of dayone executive orders expected to focus on things like drilling access for companies and liquid natural gas exports But few expect him to fulfill his promise of cutting energy prices in half no matter how aggressive the moves are in the coming months Both the US governments Energy Information Administration and the International Energy Agency IEA have projected that US oil production could move up to 15 million barrels of oil a day in the coming years from current levels above 13 million barrels a day Such a move would be significant but would be unlikely to cut prices anywhere near what Trump has promised and would also seem to fall short of Treasury Secretarydesignate Scott Bessents plan to increase oil production by the equivalent of 3 million barrels per day Trump is also acknowledging challenges with fulfilling some of his overseas promises During the campaign he promised not only to end the war in Ukraine easily but also to do it before he even takes office with as he often claimed a single phone call But the threeyearold war following Russias invasion has proven more immune to big changes so far even after a meeting between Trump and Ukraines President Volodymyr Zelensky Meanwhile a call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected soon Weve got a little progress Trump told reporters last month about ending the war but added Its a tough one Another knotty area where Trump promised quick decisive action and one he appears to be sprinting to deliver on before he takes office is in the Middle East Specifically releasing hostages held by Hamas in Gaza stemming from the Oct 7 2023 attacks in Israel Incoming Middle East envoy Steven Witkoff has been traveling to the region to take a role in the talks And Biden administration officials from the president on down are also expressing optimism that negotiators could be on the brink of an agreement During a recent press conference Trump reiterated his desire for that campaign promise to be fulfilled quickly and also what would happen if it was not done by the time he is sworn in All hell will break out he promised Ben Werschkul is

Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets Stocks recently featured in the blog include Alphabet GOOGL Tesla TSLA Uber Technologies UBER and NVIDIA NVDA The autonomous ridesharing industry is heating up despite legacy US automakers like Ford and General Motors waving the white flag in their robotaxi ambitions Ford exited the race in 2022 selling its stake in ArgoAI and General Motors followed suit in 2024 after investing 10 billion in Cruise which faced regulatory roadblocks and safety concerns Currently Alphabets Waymo is the clear leader in the US robotaxi space Waymo has achieved significant milestones in the industry Its commercial robotaxi services already operate in major cities like San Francisco Phoenix and Los Angeles Meanwhile EV giant Tesla and Amazonbacked Zoox remain in the spotlight as key contenders However a recent partnership between Uber Technologies and NVIDIA has shaken up the landscape positioning Uber as a formidable rival to Tesla in the robotaxi market While UBERs approach is very different from Teslas the companies are eyeing a huge market Statista projects autonomous ridehailing to be a 5 trillion market by 2030 As companies race to innovate 2025 promises to be a pivotal year in the robotaxi revolution Ubers partnership with NVIDIA announced last week is set to accelerate the development of autonomous driving solutions By leveraging NVIDIAs cuttingedge AI platformsCosmos and DGX Cloudand Ubers vast repository of ride data the partnership aims to create scalable and efficient AV models This alliance could redefine the competitive dynamics in the robotaxi market challenging Teslas dominance NVIDIAs Cosmos platform unveiled at CES 2025 is a breakthrough in synthetic data generation enabling the simulation of photorealistic physicsbased driving scenarios This capability is critical for training and evaluating AV systems reducing reliance on costly realworld testing Complementing this is the DGX Cloud a highperformance AI platform that provides the computational power needed to develop complex AV models at scale Together these technologies position Uber to fasttrack its autonomous driving ambitions While Tesla has invested heavily in developing its Full SelfDriving FSD technology Ubers assetlight approach through strategic partnerships may prove equally impactful Unlike Tesla which is building its AV technology inhouse Uber has adopted a partnershipdriven strategy In 2020 Uber sold its selfdriving division but retained its focus on becoming the ultimate ridehailing super app Collaborations with companies like Waymo and Aurora Innovation highlight Ubers commitment to integrating cuttingedge AV technologies into its platform With this approach Uber has avoided the massive RD costs associated with developing autonomous systems independently By integrating NVIDIAs advanced AI capabilities Uber is poised to gain a stronger foothold in the robotaxi ridehailing space Ubers dominant market share in the ridehailing industry also gives it a unique advantage With its vast network of drivers and customers Uber can quickly scale autonomous services once the technology matures Its app is designed to integrate AVs from multiple partners giving users a variety of options Tesla on the other hand is betting big on its proprietary FSD technology The companys camerabased vision system and AI algorithms aim to enable fully autonomous driving While Teslas approach has earned praise for its innovation it has also faced criticism over safety concerns With a Trumpled initiative to simplify AV regulations Tesla could gain a clearer runway to deploy its autonomous fleet Teslas FSD system is currently available in a supervised capacity but the company expects to transition to unsupervised operations in select states like Texas and California this year The company has already created a development app enabling employees to request rides to any location within the San Francisco Bay Area Teslas independence in AV development allows it to maintain full control over its technology However this strategy also comes with risks as any delays or setbacks could impact its market position Elon Musks ambitious promises including unsupervised FSD capabilities have drawn both excitement and skepticism While bullish investors think Tesla will be the leading player in the AV space critics point to Musks history of missed deadlines as a cautionary tale Tesla and Uber carry a Zacks Rank 3 Hold currently each

highlights how collaboration can drive innovation while keeping costs down For Tesla this competition increases the need to deliver on its promises Teslas FSD technology has shown potential but its success will depend on overcoming regulatory and safety challenges and meeting the timelines While Teslas independent approach shows its commitment to technological leadership Ubers strategy of

Nagasaki that the US eventually bombed I think that is very interesting Did Stimson have any influence on American policy Zhang said He did have an influence but it was only in deciding which city to bomb and which not to bomb He could not decide whether to drop atomic bombs on Japan so his influence was marginal Once some major policies strategies and guidelines are determined it is very

the feature was unleashed onto the general public in late 2024 Teslas ASS has been documented in videos shared on social media where it puts drivers in situations that lead to collisions and accidents

400 to 490 Despite writing that the stock is trading at a level that captures much of our long term potential he noted that there are catalysts that carry as much significant risk as potential benefit In the report he named the launch of a lowcost model by the end of the first half of 2025 and the launch of the robotaxi as potential catalysts with execution risk alongside other ventures like increased Chinese production of its Megapack beginning in Q1 2025 and FSD He also listed increased competition in China weaker EV demand product launch delays changes in EV regulation and incentives as well as the risk of government policies not changing in favor of autonomous technology In addition he noted that Teslas vehicles need to gain a new look in order to compete Tesla will need to refresh its vehicles to spur incremental demand Demand growth has been adversely impacted over the last year or so by slowing EV penetration but we believe the aging of its vehicle lineup has also been a factor Murphy said Tesla released the updated Model 3 in late 2023 and is on track to launch the new Model Y in early 2025 These updates include relatively modest exterior changes and more meaningful changes may be needed to drive a meaningful boost to demand Meanwhile the Model S and Model X are aging and could also use a refresh In an appearance on CNBCs The Exchange on January 10 Murphy noted that vehicle launches are something that the company has historically struggled with On vehicles launches thats probably the greatest risk Murphy said Thats something that historically the company has struggled with as there havent been that many newvehicle launches This is somewhat new to them the Model X Model S Model 3 and Model Y and there the Cybertruck none of those have gone that well in the past In 2024 Chrysler Dodge and Jeep parent Stellantis STLA has been through more than just the wringer they have seen the mop bucket the dirty floor and much more However in light of the new leadership change a lineup of new products to be launched in 2025 and the installation of a new figurehead sometime within the first half of this year there is room for some optimism One of those shining a light is analyst Harald Hendrikse at Citibank who on January 10 raised the stocks target price from 1272 to 1346 and maintained its hold position Despite the stock being down about 38 and being the worstperforming European auto marque last year Stellantis has some advantages over other rivals First its 14brand strong alliance gives it a lot of leeway and a robustly strong US market

that BofA folks came home with a few key takeaways during their visit to CES Companies are continuing to invest in the transition to EVs but there is a greater focus on driving efficiency and cost There are also fewer OEMs investing in full AV tech although there continues to be a focus on ADAS systems Murphy wrote Further suppliers are updating their strategies for China given the tough market

response to the market conditions suppliers are aiming to bring products to the market 30 faster but also make them 30 less expensive One autorelated technology that is proliferated at CES is ADAS or

liquidate its entire Tesla holding The divestment already happened months before the Tesla CEO intervened in European affairs endorsing Germanys farright party and calling for King Charles to dissolve the UK parliament Tesla CEO Elon Musk can no longer count on the backing of one of Europes biggest wealth managers though its not because of his firebrand politics On Sunday a Dutch newspaper revealed that the countrys publicsector pension fund ABP had liquidated its entire Tesla stake which was last worth 571 million 585 million as part of its active portfolio shift The news comes as Musk has divided the continent through his heavyhanded intervention into European politics including calling this month for King Charles to dissolve the UK parliament and endorsing Germanys far right in the upcoming general election Importantly however a spokesoman for ABP told Fortune the portfolio shift occurred prior to October long before Musk began harnessing the full power of his social media platform in support of Europes antiimmigrant and antiestablishment parties that espouse many of the same values as Donald Trump In hindsight the timing of the disposal wasnt ideal Tesla stock skyrocketed just two months later following the election of Donald Trump with shares hitting a record high in midDecember Nevertheless ABP pointed out that the company is managed to achieve steady longterm returns through the diversification of risk across dozens upon dozens of companies in each continentand that is just its stock portfolio Nearly 70 of its other assets are split up amongst corporate bonds real estate private equity and commodities to name just a few instruments Moreover its economic interest in Tesla while sizeable amounted to only about a tenth of what it currently has in other US megacaps For example ABP owned 56 billion in the chip company Nvidia at the end of September while its positions in Microsoft and Apple were even larger at 60 billion and 63 billion respectively It did own shares in Teslas far smaller rival Rivian but this only totaled 16 million With 533 billion in assets under management at last count ABP is Europes largest publicly managed fund responsible for financing payasyougo pension obligations for state employees and their families As many as one in six Dutch citizens is currently receiving retirement benefits or will in the future from the scheme Confirming a report in leading Dutch business daily Het Financieele Dagblad the ABP spokeswoman told Fortune the pension fund liquidated its entire stake in Tesla during the threemonth period that ended on Sept 30 Part of the reason for the liquidation was the funds opposition to Tesla redoing a shareholder vote in June on Musks pay package dubbed the largest in human history by a US litigant who successfully sued the company At current prices of 38850 per share the embedded call options in the compensation package are worth more than 110 billion net of exercise price Last January the deal was nullified by a Delaware chancery judge in a case that is now proceeding to the state supreme court While shareholders initially approved the pay deal in 2018 the Tesla board decided to rerun the vote last year in the hopes that a doover would support its legal argument At the time of the June shareholder meeting ABP called the scale of the pay package controversial Its view is not all that unusual given exorbitant compensation deals are frowned upon in egalitarian Europe especially with regards to pension funds managed for state employees and trade unions The spokeswoman couldnt confirm whether ABP owned Tesla shares in 2018 and if so whether it approved the pay deal at the time Data collected from SEC filings by Tesla shareholders indicated only one major US fund flipped from favoring the original package to opposing it in Junea move some thought was unfair especially given Musk had reached all his milestone targets Nonetheless the decision to liquidate their Tesla stock was not solely the result of his pay deal This is by no means the only reason the ABP spokeswoman stipulated She said a whole range of criteria factored into their

news and insights subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter Of all of his political targets and criticisms of the leadership of different nations Elon Musks recent criticism of Germanys government may be the strangest Or maybe riskiest is a more apt term In recent weeks Musk has loudly broadcast his support of controversial rightwing German political party AfD even hosting a livestream with AfDs leader Alice Weidel and giving the party a mainstream international platform via his massive X following But meddling in German politics is particularly risky for Musk not just because of X and the impact it could have on the platform if German officials feel that hes interfering in domestic politics German officials are said to be considering cutting ties with X due to Musks efforts But also because Teslas key European factory is based in Berlin And as such the German government could make things very difficult for Musks businesses if it decided that his influence needed to be quelled Though that hasnt necessarily stopped Musk before In early 2023 shortly after Musk took over at the platform German officials threatened X with significant fines over its failure to comply with the nations hate speech removal requirements That stemmed from Musks revised approach to content moderation and it seemed that Germany was looking to ensure that Musks new freedom of speech approach also aligned with its own rules and regulations Since then however X has seemingly been increasingly willing to meet requests from German regulators which has included providing user info to German authorities for their investigations into potential violations of the nations hate speech laws And given Teslas reliance on Germany for its EU operations that makes sense But this new antigovernment push from Musk seems to go against that entirely Will that impact Musks broader business ventures and get attention from Tesla shareholders as a result Its the first time that Musk has taken on a government in a nation that Tesla relies on and given the various regulatory challenges that Telsa has in the region it could end up being a very problematic choice for the eccentric billionaire Indeed German AntiDiscrimination Commissioner Ferda Ataman is now urging the German government to abandon X entirely while various highprofile German organizations and users have quit the app in response to Musks political stances For context X has around 14 million users in Germany And while a full regional ban of the app seems unlikely that is another potential risk of Musks overt efforts to influence local politics And while Musk is feeling empowered right now after helping Trump to victory in the US and is likely eyeing similar opportunities for power grabs in other markets he could also be close to biting the hand that feeds him and his companies particularly if AfD fails to get up in the next election The impacts of doing so could backfire significantly But then again in the case of the US they could also grant Musk significantly more political power and influence Its a highrisk highreward approach which Musk is renowned for But it could just as easily end up destroying X and tanking his other foreign business ventures Tip Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results Sign in to access your portfolio","Tip Try a valid symbol or a

Statista projects autonomous ridehailing to be a 5 trillion market by 2030 As companies race to innovate 2025 promises to be a pivotal year in the robotaxi revolution Ubers partnership with NVIDIA announced last week is set to accelerate the development of autonomous driving solutions By leveraging NVIDIAs cuttingedge AI platformsCosmos and DGX Cloudand Ubers vast repository of ride data the partnership aims to create scalable and efficient AV models This alliance could redefine the competitive dynamics in the robotaxi market challenging Teslas dominance NVIDIAs Cosmos platform unveiled at CES 2025 is a breakthrough in synthetic data generation enabling the simulation of photorealistic physicsbased driving scenarios This capability is critical for training and evaluating AV systems reducing reliance on costly realworld testing Complementing this is the DGX Cloud a highperformance AI platform that provides the computational power needed to develop complex AV models at scale Together these technologies position Uber to fasttrack its autonomous driving ambitions While Tesla has invested heavily in developing its Full SelfDriving FSD technology Ubers assetlight approach through strategic partnerships may prove equally impactful Unlike Tesla which is building its AV technology inhouse Uber has adopted a partnershipdriven strategy In 2020 Uber sold its selfdriving division but retained its focus on becoming the ultimate ridehailing super app Collaborations with companies like Waymo and Aurora Innovation highlight Ubers commitment to integrating cuttingedge AV technologies into its platform With this approach Uber has avoided the massive RD costs associated with developing autonomous systems independently By integrating NVIDIAs advanced AI capabilities Uber is poised to gain a stronger foothold in the robotaxi ridehailing space Ubers dominant market share in the ridehailing industry also gives it a unique advantage With its vast network of drivers and customers Uber can quickly scale autonomous services once the technology matures Its app is designed to integrate AVs from multiple partners giving users a variety of options Tesla on the other hand is betting big on its proprietary FSD technology The companys camerabased vision system and AI algorithms aim to enable fully autonomous driving While Teslas approach has earned praise for its innovation it has also faced criticism over safety concerns With a Trumpled initiative to simplify AV regulations Tesla could gain a clearer runway to deploy its autonomous fleet Teslas FSD system is currently available in a supervised capacity but the company expects to transition to unsupervised operations in select states like Texas and California this year The company has already created a development app enabling employees to request rides to any location within the San Francisco Bay Area Teslas independence in AV development allows it to maintain full control over its technology However this strategy also comes with risks as any delays or setbacks could impact its market position Elon Musks ambitious promises including unsupervised FSD capabilities have drawn both excitement

over 20 even as the SP 500 index had marched 15 higher But 2024 was a tale of two halves for Tesla stock and it ended the year with a monster 625 gain according to data provided by SP Global Market Intelligence Shares of fellow electric vehicle EV makers Rivian Automotive NASDAQ RIVN and Lucid Group NASDAQ LCID also had a tough start to 2024 But those stocks didnt recover ending the year down by 433 and 283 respectively The returns of these EV maker stocks may not repeat in 2025 but the lessons from 2024 should still apply Tesla was a model for stock investors learning about risk and volatility in 2024 Shares were down by about 43 at the low in late April and up by as much as 93 at the high in midDecember The recovery in the second half of the year came for several reasons that might help determine where Tesla stock goes in 2025 EV startups Rivian and Lucid have their own potential catalysts to boost shares in 2025 but risks remain high for those stocks Even considering the winning year that Tesla shareholders experienced investors in the EV sector should be comfortable understanding the risk profile in general One of the biggest drags last year on the EV sector was a question of sagging consumer demand Slower sales growth led some EV producers to throttle back expansion plans Even Tesla pushed back a previously announced plan to build a new factory in Mexico Last year was the first that Tesla failed to increase EV deliveries year over year since it began producing meaningful volumes It did come close however with a drop of just over 1 But Teslas strong financial condition allows it to weather a slowdown Rivian and Lucid remain unprofitable however and losses are mounting for both companies Investors reacted by selling both stocks with sales and production volumes still well below where they need to be This year will be important for both as new products are being introduced Rivians production volume held steady as it spent some time retooling its plant to prepare for the nextgeneration R2 electric SUVs it will start making later this year Rivian also suffered a parts supply issue that slowed production levels The company says that supply chain issue is now in the past Lucid delivered over 10000 vehicles for the first time in 2024 and will begin selling its new Gravity SUV in 2025 Like its Air sedan that vehicle will also cater to luxury buyers Investors shouldnt expect Lucid shares to rebound in 2025 unless the company reports impressive Gravity orders and sales Tesla stock gains accelerated in the latter months of 2024 as investors viewed Presidentelect Donald Trumps victory as a potential boon for the company Even if the incoming administration eliminates incentives for EV adoption the EV leader is in a strong position as competitors struggle to stem losses And Tesla is more than an EV company Its energy segment is growing quickly Energy storage needs are increasing as renewable energy production continues to increase Teslas energy storage deployments increased 114 year over year The company has also invested heavily in artificial intelligence AI infrastructure as it seeks to perfect its full selfdriving FSD software That could lead to additional subscription revenue from Tesla owners as well as a potential fleet of selfdriving taxis Robotics is another division of the business that could provide a major potential boost to earnings The future potential is much of what investors see with Tesla And its why the stock is more in favor than other EV companies While risks remain in terms of both valuation and execution it likely will maintain its lead over other EV makers for investors in 2025 When our analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen After all Stock Advisors total

symbol or a specific company name for relevant results Tesla NASDAQTSLA has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 80 over the last three months Given that the market rewards strong financials in the longterm we wonder if that is the case in this instance In this article we decided to focus on Teslas ROE Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested In simpler terms it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholders equity Check out our latest analysis for Tesla The formula for return on equity is Return on Equity Net Profit from continuing operations Shareholders Equity So based on the above formula the ROE for Tesla is 18 US13b US71b Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024 The return is the income the business earned over the last year So this means that for every 1 of its shareholders investments the company generates a profit of 018 Thus far we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or retain we are then able to evaluate a companys future ability to generate profits Generally speaking other things being equal firms with a high return on equity and profit retention have a higher growth rate than firms that dont share these attributes To start with Teslas ROE looks acceptable And on comparing with the industry we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 15 This probably goes some way in explaining Teslas significant 51 net income growth over the past five years amongst other factors We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the companys earnings growth For example it is possible that the companys management has made some good strategic decisions or that the company has a low payout ratio We then compared Teslas net income growth with the industry and were pleased to see that the companys growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 20 in the same 5year period Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock Its important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the companys expected earnings growth or decline Doing so will help them establish if the stocks future looks promising or ominous Is Tesla fairly valued compared to other companies These 3 valuation measures might help you decide Tesla doesnt pay any regular dividends currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we discussed above Overall we are quite pleased with Teslas performance Specifically we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings That being so a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth To know more

happened in the third quarter which ended over three months ago and the fourthquarter update will not be available until midFebruary So heres a more current look at Tesla and Amazon Tesla shares fell sharply on Jan 2 when the company reported 495570 fourthquarter deliveries about 10000 units short of the consensus estimate But the stock rebounded the next day on reports of strong sales in China and an upgrade from Canaccord Importantly while Tesla led the market in electric car sales through November its market share has declined across all three of its major markets US Europe and China Tesla has a few important catalysts on the horizon that could lead to upward revisions in earnings estimates which may send shares higher First it plans to launch a sub30000 vehicle reportedly called the Model Q in the first half of 2025 Second touting a 1000fold improvement in its full selfdriving FSD software this year Tesla plans to launch an unsupervised version of the software in California and Texas next year Additionally Tesla plans to launch an autonomous ridesharing service in California and Texas in 2025 and potentially other states too according to CEO Elon Musk That could be an inflection point for the business Musk has previously estimated robotaxis could push Teslas gross margin to 70 or higher Comparatively its gross margin was about 20 in the most recent quarter Wall Street expects Teslas adjusted earnings to increase 26 over the next four quarters That makes its current valuation of 164 times adjusted earnings look outrageously expensive But not all Wall Street analysts are pessimistic Dan Ives at Wedbush on Nov 29 said Today I view Tesla as the most undervalued AI name on the market Personally I think the hedge funds that bought Tesla in the third quarter were making a bet on Donald Trump winning the presidential election I would not be surprised if many sold down their positions during the fourth quarter especially since the stock has skyrocketed postelection Having said that investors that are confident Tesla can disrupt the mobility and transportation industries should own a longterm position Amazon has three growth engines in ecommerce digital advertising and public cloud services The company not only has a strong position in those markets but also its using artificial intelligence AI to generate more revenue and improve efficiency across all three business segments For instance Amazon operates the most visited online marketplace in the world and it supports its merchants with a vast logistics network Machine learning models informed by mountains of shopper data make product recommendations to improve sales on the marketplace They also optimize inventory and delivery routes to make logistics more efficient Amazon is the thirdlargest ad tech company as measured by sales and its gaining market share so quickly it could take second place from Meta Platforms before 2030 according to eMarketer Machine learning models informed by marketplace data help brands target ad campaigns and generative AI helps brands create media content for those campaigns Finally Amazon Web Services AWS is the largest public cloud as measured by revenue from infrastructure and platform services Its 31 market share nearly equals the 33 market share Microsoft and Alphabet have combined CEO Andy Jassy recently said In the last 18 months AWS has released nearly twice as many machine learning and generative AI features as the other leading cloud providers combined Wall Street anticipates Amazons adjusted earnings will increase 26 over the next four quarters That makes the current valuation of 46 times adjusted earnings look reasonable For that reason I think the hedge fund billionaires that sold Amazon in the third quarter made a mistake Indeed the stock trades at 219 per share today which 10 above its thirdquarter high of 200 per share and 36 above its thirdquarter low of 161 per share Ever feel like you missed the

be a breakthrough He also highlights that robotics will boost the economy in its ability to revolutionize industries and reshape the future of work For example humanoid robots are expected to

results Tesla NASDAQ TSLA is a leading manufacturer of electric vehicles EVs whereas Meta Platforms NASDAQ META is home to social networks like Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp In other words they are two completely different companies But they have one important thing in common They are betting big on artificial intelligence AI Tesla stock and Meta stock both soared by more than 60 in 2024 ending the year near record highs But 2025 is here and its time for investors to look forward so which one is the better buy now I think the answer is clear Tesla is one of the most exciting stories in the AI industry and its stock has no shortage of bullish price targets from Wall Street analysts Most of the optimism stems from the companys full selfdriving FSD software which owners of its passenger EVs can already use in beta mode Tesla CEO Elon Musk believes autonomy is the future of the automotive industry The company unveiled its Cybercab robotaxi in October which doesnt have pedals or even a steering wheel because FSD will handle the entire driving process The company plans to build a ridehailing network where the Cybercab can autonomously haul passengers and earn revenue around the clock Since it wont need a human driver this revenue stream should have a very high profit margin Moreover consumers will be able to buy the Cybercab for personal use or they can purchase a fleet of them and operate a ridehailing service of their own using Teslas network Simply put this new product platform unlocks several new revenue streams for the company which is why analyst Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities believes it could be a 1 trillion opportunity But Tesla faces a few shortterm problems First it delivered 179 million passenger EVs during 2024 which was a drop of 11 compared to 2023 EV sales still account for almost 80 of the companys total revenue so it cant afford for this business to be shrinking That brings me to the second problem the Cybercab isnt scheduled for mass production until 2026 which means Teslas passenger EV sales need to impress investors for at least another year Moreover the companys FSD software doesnt have regulatory approval for unsupervised use anywhere in the US right now Investors are speculating that Tesla will face a friendlier regulatory environment under the Trump administration which could fasttrack the approval process especially since Musk was a major donor to the incoming presidents election campaign Musk hopes FSD will be fully approved in at least California and Texas this year Still Tesla stock trades at an extremely high valuation more on this later based entirely on products that arent even available yet That poses a significant risk to investors who buy it now But heres the upshot Cathie Woods Ark Investment Management thinks Tesla stock could soar 530 to reach 2600 by 2029 if the Cybercab and FSD are successful so the payoff could be substantial for investors with a highenough risk tolerance to buy it today Over 98 of Metas revenue comes from selling advertising slots to businesses on its social networks like Facebook and Instagram The formula for success is quite simple The longer each user spends browsing those platforms each day the more ads they see and the more revenue Meta pulls in Meta spent the last couple of years building AI into its recommendation engine which learns what content each user likes to see and shows them more of it to keep them online a little longer In the third quarter of 2024 ended Sept 30 CEO Mark Zuckerberg said AIpowered recommendations drove an 8 increase in the amount of time users spent on Facebook for the year to date and a 6 increase for Instagram But thats only the tip of Metas growing AI strategy The company also launched an AI chatbot called Meta AI in 2023 and it has already amassed 500 million monthly active users Its embedded in each of the companys apps where users can ask it questions on almost any topic or prompt it to generate images Meta AI is free to use but I predict businesses will eventually pay money to embed product links into its responses when users ask it a relevant question which will unlock a new revenue stream for Meta Meta AI is powered by the companys family of large language models LLMs called Llama Unlike models from leading AI startups like OpenAI Llama is open source which allows Meta to crowdsource bug detection and improvements from an entire community of developers With over 600 million downloads Llama is the most popular family of opensource models in the world Meta will report its official financial results for 2024 on Jan 29 and the company is likely to tell investors it spent around 40 billion building data center infrastructure for the year to further its AI ambitions The company plans to launch Llama 4 this year which Zuckerberg thinks could be the most advanced LLM in the world It will pave the way for new AI features for Metas social networks and new opportunities to generate revenue Turning to 2025 Wall Streets consensus estimate provided by Yahoo suggests Meta could deliver a record 186 billion in revenue and 2538 in earnings per share Based on those figures its stock looks very attractive right now In my view this choice comes down to valuation As I touched on Tesla stock is pricey right now it trades at an eyewatering pricetoearnings PE ratio of 108 which makes it three times more expensive than the 321 PE ratio of the Nasdaq100 Meta stock on the other hand trades at a very enticing PE ratio of just 291 We dont actually know if Teslas business will grow in 2025 Elon Musk says it will he thinks passenger EV deliveries could grow by as much as 30 but its a show me story given the companys 2024 results Plus I cant recommend making a large bet on Tesla stock at this price based on what might happen with the Cybercab and FSD in 2026 Meta has a better opportunity to financially benefit from AI in 2025 because incremental improvements in its recommendation engine alone could immediately drive more advertising revenue Combined with its attractive valuation I think its a much safer stock to buy for this year Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most

has led to a lot of expensive valuations for the betterperforming stocks But there are still some bargains to be had even in the tech sectors You just have to know where to look and pay closer attention to the numbers especially the forwardlooking ones Lets look at three stocks trading at attractive valuations given the opportunities in front of them Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA has been one of the bestperforming stocks over the past few years Nonetheless the stock still trades at an attractive valuation On a forward pricetoearnings PE basis the company is valued at 295 based on 2025 analyst estimates while its priceearningstogrowth ratio PEG is 091 times A PEG below 1 is typically viewed as undervalued and growth stocks will often trade with PEGs well above 1 Meanwhile the company grew its revenue by 94 year over year last quarter and analysts are projecting more than 50 revenue growth in 2025 Nvidia has established itself as the dominant leader in graphic processing units GPUs through its CUDA software platform which makes it easy for developers to program GPUs for various tasks related to artificial intelligence AI GPUs have become the goto chips upon which to train AI models and run inference given their superior processing power over other massproduced chips The company has greatly benefited from the early AI infrastructure buildout but this buildout still appears to be in its early innings Nvidias largest customer Microsoft just announced it would spend a whopping 80 billion on AI data centers this year while AI models need exponentially more GPUs to be trained on as they become more advanced There is currently talk that AI models will be trained on 1 million AI chip clusters in the near future which is up substantially from recent models such as Llama 4 which was trained on 160000 GPUs Given Nvidias valuation and opportunity this is a great time to pick up the stock Trading at a forward PE of under 185 times 2025 analyst estimates Alphabet NASDAQ GOOGL NASDAQ GOOG is one of the cheapest megacap tech stocks out there However the company has still been demonstrating strong growth Last quarter it grew its overall revenue by 15 year over year and its earnings per share by 37 Its strong growth is being led by its cloud computing unit which saw its revenue climb 35 last quarter while its operating income skyrocketed from 266 million to 195 billion Alphabet has credited its strong cloud computing growth to customers adopting its AI platform to build and customize AI models and applications The company notes that its use of customized TPUs tensor processing units with GPUs has been a differentiator allowing it to reduce inference processing times and lowering costs Of course Alphabet is best known for its Google search engine which has made it the dominant global search leader with nearly a 90 market share Alphabet has a big opportunity with AI in this area as historically it has only served ads to about 20 of its search results By developing new ad forms it should be able to monetize some of this traffic that benefits from its AI Overviews The company is also looking to push its Gemini chat app as well as other AI tools such as Veo 2 its texttovideo AI generator In addition to cloud computing and search Alphabet also owns the most viewed video service in YouTube a huge adtech platform as well as businesses focused on autonomous driving Waymo and quantum computing This gives investors a great combination of leading and emerging businesses at an attractive valuation Another inexpensive stock in the tech space is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing NYSE TSM or TSMC The stock trades at a forward PE of only 192 times 2025 analyst estimates and a PEG of 064 TSMC is the worlds leading semiconductor contract manufacturer making chips for some of the largest semiconductor chip designers in the world including Apple Nvidia and Broadcom Through its scale and technological expertise the company has become the goto chip manufacturer for advanced chips such as those used for AI While its competitors have struggled TSMC has thrived as evidenced by its growing revenue and expanding gross margin Last quarter the company grew its revenue by 36 year over year while its gross margin improved by 460 basis points to 578 TSMC has been increasing its capacity to meet the growing demand for highend chips while also seeing strong pricing power According to Morgan Stanley it is set to raise prices by up to 10 for AI semiconductors and chiponwaferonsubstrate products this year Increased capacity along with prices is a nice combination that will drive revenue and earnings growth this year and into the future Given its valuation and the opportunities ahead of it TSMC is an attractive stock to consider

relevant results Apple NASDAQ AAPL stock has been a big winner since the start of the pandemic soaring in value as the companys market capitalization surpassed 3 trillion The party may finally come to an end this year though as a combination of stagnating iPhone sales the potential collapse of a 20 billion annual revenue stream and a lofty valuation come together to put pressure on the stock While anything could happen in the stock market it will be tough for Apple stock to keep its rally going throughout 2025 As much as Apple tries to convince consumers that each years iPhone models are worth the upgrade thats increasingly not the case In the early days of the smartphone industry smartphones improved drastically each year As the industry has matured its getting hard to tell the difference between this years flagship smartphones and last years flagship smartphones Apples big thing last year was Apple Intelligence the companys suite of AIpowered tools for the iPhone and its other devices So far Apples AI push has been a swing and a miss One survey found that 73 of iPhone users said the AI features add little or no value Apple Intelligence will likely improve over time but for now its not helping the company sell more iPhones Total iPhone revenue in the twelve months that ended Sept 28 was roughly unchanged from the previous 12month period and iPhone sales reportedly declined by 5 during the holiday quarter Its not clear how Apple can reverse these trends and with the iPhone accounting for more than half of the companys total revenue any sales decline is going to be tough to offset with other products Apple currently receives in excess to 20 billion annually from Alphabet in a deal that makes Google the default search engine on the Safari web browser These payments show up in Apples services segment and theyre essentially pure profit Theres a real chance that this gravy train will come to an end as Google readies for an antitrust trial over online search set for April Apple has asked to participate in the trial to defend its own interests as Google faces the prospect of being forced to divest major assets That 20 billion annual payment to Apple could end up on the chopping block if its viewed as anticompetitive If you assume this payment is pure profit it represents around onesixth of Apples annual operating income Losing it would be a significant blow to the bottom line Despite stagnating iPhone sales and uncertainty around the Google payments Apple stock trades for about 38 times trailingtwelvemonth earnings The last time Apple was this expensive was during the early days of the pandemic when booming demand for PCs smartphones and other gadgets lifted sales One important thing to consider is interest rates The stock market doesnt exist in a vacuum and valuations that investors are willing to pay are ultimately a function of the alternatives available Since the Federal Reserve began cutting rates the yield on the 10year US Treasury has been soaring and its now closing in on 5 Why are rising bond yields potentially bad for stocks with lofty valuations The 10year Treasury is often considered the riskfree rate The higher the riskfree rate is the higher the return other assets must offer to compensate For a stock like Apple where revenue growth is sluggish and profits may come under pressure this year a pricetoearnings ratio of nearly 40 becomes much more difficult to justify as the riskfree rate rises Shares of Apple have tripled in the past five years despite revenue growing at a far slower rate With the valuation at elevated levels a correction could be in the cards for the tech stock this year Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks Then youll want to hear this On rare occasions

10 Stock Picks In this article we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc NASDAQGOOGL stands against other top stock picks in Billionaire George Soros portfolio When it comes to financial lore youd struggle to find an investor who is as controversial as George Soros With a net worth of 72 billion Soros has made a name for himself by correctly spotting market trends which has led to millions if not billions of dollars in strategic savings or profits He cemented his reputation in financial legend for instance when he famously shorted the British pound in 1992 and made off with 1 billion profit in a single day Soros is also known for overseeing the Quantum Fund which from 1970 to 2000 produced an outstanding average yearly return of 30 Having founded his hedge fund Soros Fund Management back in the 1970s Soros investment philosophy is centered around his concept of reflexivity Soros believes that players in the market can influence the market themselves causing feedback loops that can cause price deviations The investor makes use of this idea to single out mispricings in the market to create returns The best application for this concept is during economic bubbles According to Soros When I see a bubble forming I rush in to buy adding fuel to the fire Of course that doesnt mean one can always hit the bullseye we saw this during the dotcom era almost 25 years ago where Soros admitted to being beaten by billions of dollars in losses Soros Fund Managements 13F portfolio contained 692 billion in securities as of September 30 up from 556 billion a quarter earlier About 98 and 74 of those securities were in the technology and services sectors respectively down from 117 and 106 from the quarter prior Healthcare basic materials and financials also constituted a sizable portion of the funds portfolio as of the third quarter of 2024 Its no surprise to anyone who has followed George Soros over the years that the billionaire has a certain disdain for artificial intelligence Soros claims that the technology poses a significant threat especially to what he calls open societies simply because AI can not only produce instruments of surveillance but it can also be liable in its misuse In Soros ideal world AI regulations would have to be globally enforceable though he admits that such a dream might not be realized because of the dynamics of governance across the globe In a MarketWatch article from 2023 Soros outlined some of his thoughts regarding the technology Heres what he wrote We human beings are both participants and observers in the world in which we live As participants we want to change the world in our favor as observers we want to understand reality as it is These two objectives interfere with each other I regard this as an important insight which allows me to distinguish between right and wrong For this article we scanned Soros Fund Managements Q3 portfolio and chose its top 10 stock picks The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the funds stakes in them Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into The reason is simple our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock

investigated for allegedly harvesting data from news websites to fuel its artificial intelligence system The technology giants search engine and advertising practices are to be examined by the Competition and Markets Authority CMA in an investigation of potentially exploitative conduct against internet users and publishers The regulator is to review Googles impact on advertisers and rival search engines considering whether the company is using its dominant position to suffocate competitors or boost its own products unfairly The watchdog added that it would explore whether news publishers deserved to be paid for the use of their content by Google in its search or AI products The CMA will consider imposing restrictions on how Google which accounts for almost 90pc of UK search traffic gathers data from news websites to power its AI products The areas being investigated include its new AI Overviews search tool which compiles data from multiple news sources and summarises it at the top of its search results to answer user queries and its Gemini chatbot Publishers have warned these tools risk steering traffic away from their websites The investigation is the first under the UKs new digital markets competition rules which came into effect on Jan 1 providing the regulator with greater powers to investigate and fine companies deemed to have strategic market status The initial investigation will seek to establish whether Google has this level of market power and whether anything needs to be done to curtail its alleged dominance Under its new powers the CMA can fine companies up to 10pc of their turnover for ignoring its rulings or demand companies be broken up The watchdog said it would explore Googles use of publisher content without fair terms and conditions and whether it needed to order Google to ensure fair terms including payment terms for the use of publisher content in its search results or AI Overviews The CMA said it could consider limiting Googles use of data it harvests from the web for the training and fine tuning of AI models It said publishers currently had no realistic option but to allow Google to crawl their website and that Google could use this data to give it an advantage over competing AI developers The watchdog also said it could give publishers more control over how their data is used by Googles AI Google has previously said publishers have tools allowing them to optout from AI training The regulator will consult on any proposed remedies and a final decision is expected in October The investigation comes despite Rachel Reeves the Chancellor preparing to meet the heads of multiple City regulators on Thursday to strip back red tape to encourage growth On Monday Sir Keir Starmer the Prime Minister also

while the movie played in the background over our Thanksgiving break The answer from Googles AI overview Marlon Brando was not yet old enough to act in The Godfather when he died in 2004 at the age of 80 It was one of the funnier somewhat surprising screwups wed seen from Gemini which like all publicly available artificial intelligence tools is prone to what the tech industry calls hallucinations He screenshot the answer so that we could have a laugh about it and then scrolled down to find the first nonsponsored nonAI search result an entry from one of the most reliable places on the internet Wikipedia If Id written that last sentence at the start of my career no editor would have allowed it into print You cant trust something that anyone can edit the thinking went and so it became a bad word in journalism and academia Dont cite it dont even look at it Or if you do for Gods sake dont let anyone see you But over the past two decades the freetouse online encyclopedia has carried on with its mission expanding its global community of volunteer editors known as Wikipedians and ultimately resisting the kinds of platform decay that have claimed other 2000sera internet phenoms like Facebook Twitter and to some extent Google In a statement to Nightcap Google said it maintains a high quality bar with all Search features and that its extensive testing found people find their results more helpful with AI Overviews Meta and X didnt immediately respond to a request for comment Whats emerged is a port in a storm of misinformation and a potential roadmap for startups as Big Tech continues to abdicate any responsibility for the garbage littering its platforms in the form of AIgenerated slop and humangenerated propaganda By the way Brando was 47 at the time he filmed The Godfather and turned 48 shortly after its release in 1972 according to Wikipedia and multiple obituaries Wikipedia is the seventh most popular website on the planet according to analytics firm Similarweb after Google YouTube Facebook Instagram X and WhatsApp It is the only one on that list not owned by Alphabet Meta or Elon Musk who has recently taken aim at what he called Wokepedia for what he and the MAGA right views as liberal bias The nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation hosts Wikipedia generating the bulk of its financing through small donations and grants Thats part of the secret to its success according to Molly White a researcher and prolific Wikipedia editor With Wikipedia there isnt some huge corporation enriching themselves off the backs of the free editing White told me Whereas over on Twitter your free labor is going toward a corporation that is directly enriching Elon Musk Musk promptly fired Twitters trust and safety team when he bought Twitter now called X in 2022 The site now relies on users to factcheck one another through a community notes system that has done little to counter false information according to the Center for Countering Digital Hate X users whove stepped up to try to debunk lies and flag propaganda recently told the Washington Post that their efforts often feel like a game of whackamole Thats the same system that Mark Zuckerberg revealed last week for Meta which is preparing to fire its thirdparty professional factcheckers who are already straining against a flood of conspiracy theories By Zuckerbergs own admission that move is a tradeoff that will mean allowing more bad stuff on the platforms Wikipedias crowdsourcing model isnt perfect the site has an entry on its own reliability in which it acknowledges instances of vandalism and it keeps a list of hoaxes that have taken off there Still as a general rule youre not going to find Marlon Brandos Wikipedia entry not suggest that he wasnt in The Godfather When someone tries to insert bad intel into a Wikipedia page that edit gets flagged to hundreds or thousands of Wikipedians around the world who keep tabs on various pages More than 280000 editors contribute to Wikimedia projects every month according to the organization I asked White why the community notes model which on paper seems in line with the Wikipedia ethos doesnt seem to be working so well on X I think that people who are writing community notes are very much in a reactive frame of mind where its not about providing highquality information its about preventing some of the most egregious misinformation from proliferating With Wikipedia she added theres a baseline level of behavior that the community of editors reinforces People who are trolling or expressing their own political beliefs are not tolerated on the site No wonder Musk dislikes it Bottom line The internets most popular sites are in a state of transition X and Meta are doing away with guardrails Google is forcing unreliable AI to the top of its search results Meanwhile TikTok is facing a ban in the US and lawmakers are forcing Pornhub to block its content in roughly a third of US states Wikipedias stodgy nonprofit model suddenly looks a lot more appealing Its communityfocused approach to moderation is also taking off with platforms like Bluesky which has reportedly surged past 21 million users amid an exodus from X This idea of a social network with the benevolent dictator isnt a particularly sustainable thing White said It works until that benevolent dictator either sells the platform or has a

system With a possible TikTok ban just days away many US users are looking for alternative social media platforms to help them keep up with pop culture or provide the type of entertaining videos that popularized the shortform video app TikTok which has been a cultural phenomenon could be banned on Jan 19 under a law that forces the platform to cut ties with its Chinabased parent company ByteDance

with an investigation into Googles search and search ad businesses Under beefedup rules that took effect this month designed to protect consumers and businesses from unfair practices by Big Tech companies the Competition and Markets Authority said it would determine whether Google should be given strategic market status that would require imposing changes to the companys behavior The investigation adds to global scrutiny that the US tech giant is facing The Competition and Markets Authority said it will examine whether Google is using its position in the market to stifle innovation and block rivals The regulator said it will look in particular at Googles role in shaping the development of new artificial services and interfaces such as answer engines in ways that limit the competitive constraint they impose on Google Search AIpowered chatbots have become increasingly popular with internet users looking for information online Google last year retooled its search

field for all businesses large and small to succeed The CMA will also look into concerns about exploitative conduct by Google including its practice of collecting vast amounts of consumer data without informed consent and its use of content by website publishers which could range from major media outlets to startups focusing on narrow subjects without paying them fairly It will also investigate whether Google is giving preference to its own services such as specialized search shopping or travel services The UK investigation is the latest salvo in an onslaught of regulatory pressure that Google is facing on both sides of the Atlantic In both the US and Canada authorities are targeting Googles ad business with lawsuits accusing the company of anticompetitive or monopolistic conduct in the digital ad industry which they want to resolve by breaking up the company European Union regulators meanwhile have been carrying out their own antitrust investigation and signaled that they would push for Google to sell off parts of its business in order to satisfy concerns about its lucrative digital ad business The CMA has until October to finish its investigation and said it could for example force Google to make changes to its data practices The regulator has said it expects to open three to four strategic market status investigations of the very largest tech companies in the

index which consists of the 100 largest stocks that trade on the Nasdaq stock exchange The Invesco QQQ proudly boasts that it has outperformed the SP 500 by more than 400 percentage points since its launch in 1999 but is that enough for the ETF to be a millionaire maker Lets find out An investment in the Invesco QQQ is largely an investment in the technology sector Approximately 60 of the ETFs holdings are classified as being technology stocks Thats not a bad thing as technology companies have been leading the way in the market for the past few decades In fact many of the largest companies in the world are now technology or certainly techadjacent companies Within the SP 500 which comprises the 500 largest companies traded in the US eight of its top 10 holdings would fit in this category Technology is changing the world we live in and technology companies have grown to become the biggest companies in the world as a result Meanwhile we appear to be in the early innings of the next big technology trend with artificial intelligence AI Generative AI which can create content based on user questions or prompts is just getting started and entering our lives This can be seen in things like asking ChatGPT a question to get an answer using Alphabets Veo 2 to create a video using just text or using Microsofts 365 copilots help you more quickly complete tasks at work In addition companies are already beginning to introduce the next wave of AI with agentic AI where AI agents can go out and autonomously complete takes under the parameters given with little human involvement needed The Invesco QQQ is a great way to invest in many of the top companies riding these trends Its top holdings are very weighted toward companies that are starting to benefit from AI This includes Apple 94 weighting Nvidia 88 Microsoft 81 Amazon 6 Alphabet 57 Broadcom 45 Tesla 37 and Meta Platforms 34 Costco is its largest nontech holding with a 26 weighting This emphasis on large tech stocks have led to outsized returns over the years Over the past decade the QQQ ETF has generated a cumulative return of 4359 easily outpacing the SP 500s SNPINDEX GSPC 2425 return over the same period That equates to an average annual return of 183 for the ETF over that period The past five years have been even better with an average annual return of 199 compared to 145 for the SP 500 This outperformance also hasnt just come from one or two large outlier years of outsized performance According to Invesco the QQQ ETF has outperformed the SP 500 87 of the time over the past decade based on rolling monthly periods Even with its stellar returns the past decade the QQQ ETF wont turn a small investment into 1 million in a decade A 10000 investment a decade ago would be worth 53591 today as of the end of 2024 The key to the QQQ ETF helping investors become millionaires is consistent investing through the use of a dollarcost averaging strategy This is investing in the ETF at regular intervals regardless of price and allows investors to ride the market when its going higher and to load up on more shares when the market is down Over the long run this is a proven strategy to help accumulate wealth If you were to make just a 10000 initial investment and invest an additional 1000 at the end of each month over the next 20 years that investment would be worth approximately 1 million with a 12 average annual return Meanwhile approximately 75 of that would come from market gains Note that actual returns would vary based on market fluctuations over that period but this gives you a good sense of the time frame needed All in all the Invesco QQQ ETF has a long proven track record of outperformance making it a great investment option albeit one that is admittedly more on the aggressive side given its large weighting toward tech stocks With the ETF pulling back a bit from its recent highs now could be a great time to start investing for the long term Before you buy stock

We welcome the recognition of the need to align regulatory decisions with the governments growth mission Urging a proinnovation evidencebased regime Bethell added that overly prescriptive digital

include Alphabet GOOGL Tesla TSLA Uber Technologies UBER and NVIDIA NVDA The autonomous ridesharing industry is heating up despite legacy US automakers like Ford and General Motors waving the white flag in their robotaxi ambitions Ford exited the race in 2022 selling its stake in ArgoAI and General Motors followed suit in 2024 after investing 10 billion in Cruise which faced regulatory roadblocks and safety concerns Currently Alphabets Waymo is the clear leader in the US robotaxi space Waymo has achieved significant milestones in the industry Its commercial robotaxi services already operate in major cities like San Francisco Phoenix and Los Angeles Meanwhile EV giant Tesla and Amazonbacked Zoox remain in the spotlight as key contenders However a recent partnership between Uber Technologies and NVIDIA has shaken up the landscape positioning Uber as a formidable rival to Tesla in the robotaxi market While UBERs approach is very different from Teslas the companies are eyeing a huge market Statista projects autonomous ridehailing to be a 5 trillion market by 2030 As companies race to innovate 2025 promises to be a pivotal year in the robotaxi revolution Ubers partnership with NVIDIA announced last week is set to accelerate the development of autonomous driving solutions By leveraging NVIDIAs cuttingedge AI platformsCosmos and DGX Cloudand Ubers vast repository of ride data the partnership aims to create scalable and efficient AV models This alliance could redefine the competitive dynamics in the robotaxi market challenging Teslas dominance NVIDIAs Cosmos platform unveiled at CES 2025 is a breakthrough in synthetic data generation enabling the simulation of photorealistic physicsbased driving scenarios This capability is critical for training and evaluating AV systems reducing reliance on costly realworld testing Complementing this is the DGX Cloud a highperformance AI platform that provides the computational power needed to develop complex AV models at scale Together these technologies position Uber to fasttrack its autonomous driving ambitions While Tesla has invested heavily in developing its Full SelfDriving FSD technology Ubers assetlight approach through strategic partnerships may prove equally impactful Unlike Tesla which is building its AV technology inhouse Uber has adopted a partnershipdriven strategy In 2020 Uber sold its selfdriving division but retained its focus on becoming the ultimate ridehailing super app Collaborations with companies like Waymo and Aurora Innovation highlight Ubers commitment to integrating cuttingedge AV technologies into its platform With this approach Uber has avoided the massive RD costs associated with developing autonomous systems independently By integrating NVIDIAs advanced AI capabilities Uber is poised to gain a stronger foothold in the robotaxi ridehailing space Ubers dominant market share in the ridehailing industry also gives it a unique advantage With its vast network of drivers and customers Uber can quickly scale autonomous services once the technology matures Its app is designed to integrate AVs from multiple partners giving users a variety of options Tesla on the other hand is betting big on its proprietary FSD technology The companys camerabased vision system and AI algorithms aim to enable fully autonomous driving While Teslas approach has earned praise for its innovation it has also faced criticism over safety concerns With a Trumpled initiative to simplify AV regulations Tesla could gain a clearer runway to deploy its autonomous fleet Teslas FSD system is currently available in a supervised capacity but the company expects to transition to unsupervised operations in select states like Texas and California this year The company has already created a development app enabling employees to request rides to any location within the San Francisco Bay Area Teslas independence in AV development allows it to maintain full control over its technology However this strategy also comes with risks as any delays or setbacks could impact its market position Elon Musks ambitious promises including unsupervised FSD capabilities have drawn both excitement and skepticism While bullish investors think Tesla will be the leading player in the AV space critics point to Musks history of missed deadlines as a cautionary tale Tesla and Uber carry a

start This is precisely what happened with quantum computing stocks in late 2024 Stocks like Rigetti NASDAQ RGTI Quantum Computing NASDAQ QUBT and IonQ NYSE IONQ have shot up hundreds of percentage points in the last six months crushing the returns of the hottest artificial intelligence AI stocks The momentum began with the idea that quantum computing could help with AI workloads and was accelerated by a breakthrough quantum computer chip from Alphabets NASDAQ GOOGNASDAQ GOOGL Google 2025 has been a different story so far The three quantum computing stocks referenced above collapsed in the first few days of this year after comments by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during the CES tech expo in Las Vegas Should you buy the dip on these quantum computing stocks in January Or is this shortlived party officially over Lets dive further into these businesses and find out Quantum computing is an earlystage technology that researchers have worked on for decades Using the mysterious properties of quantum mechanics quantum computers can solve highly complex problems that are virtually impossible for traditional computers to solve in a reasonable amount of time These range from pharmaceutical simulations to atomic structures encryption or simply predicting the weather more accurately Rigetti Quantum Computing and IonQ are three companies working to make quantum computing a viable business If they do it could revolutionize the entire computer industry which is massive when you combine both personal and commercial use cases In fact some researchers believe that quantum computers will be so powerful they will render the current encryption methods of cryptocurrencies broken Optimism with these new technologies has abounded in the wake of the new artificial intelligence tools that have taken the world by storm These tools require a lot of computing resources to scale up which quantum computers could theoretically provide Microcap stocks such as Rigetti have soared on this optimism Further fuel was thrown on the fire when Googles Quantum AI lab announced a new quantum computer chip called Willow which Wall Street took as a sign that quantum computing is much closer to commercialization Quantum Computing shot up over 1000 in the last six months after the news was announced These headline reactions reversed when Huang soured on the immediate quantum timeline Speaking during a QA session at CES earlier in January he said that quantum computing commercialization was likely 15 to 30 years away This is what caused the quantum computing stocks to collapse as much as 60 since the start of 2025 It can pay to listen to Huang It is perhaps his top priority at Nvidia to figure out what the future of computing will be From his comments it is clear that he is bullish on the potential of quantum computing Nvidia works with a lot of these companies but that he believes it will be many years before these products reach true commercialization Quantum computers at the moment are tiny wildly expensive and only operate in the most optimal conditions When a quantum system interacts with its environment it can screw up the whole computing process It is also extremely difficult at least with current research methods to scale and correct errors with quantum computers This makes them too unreliable to be used in commercial applications They only work in the most optimal conditions in research labs The technology has been proven to work and shows immense promise but there are still many technical hurdles that engineers need to solve with quantum computing It will likely take billions of dollars in research spending before they are solved Investors could talk all day about the promise of quantum computers But thats all it is right now a promise These quantum computing companies generate minimal amounts of revenue that combine to less than 50 million over the last 12 months All three have wildly negative profit margins If Huang is correct that it will take at least 15 years for quantum computers to be commercialized this is likely 15 years when IonQ Quantum Computing and Rigetti are losing money These are not situations you want to invest in Even if you assume all three of these companies will help bring quantum computers to market who is to say they will get there first Googleparent Alphabet has vast resources and could win the race to quantum supremacy It is unclear when quantum computers will get commercialized and it is not guaranteed that these small quantum computing companies will be the ones to do it All three

again on Monday for the second time in just three sessions after Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg added his name to the growing chorus of skeptics on the new technology Last Wednesday quantum stocks plunged more than 40 after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at CES that quantum computing technology was 15 to 30 years away from being very useful Zuckerberg appeared to express similar skepticism in an interview over the weekend with Joe Rogan Additionally tech stocks fell broadly today in what seemed to be riskoff behavior as bets on Federal Reserve rate cuts this year declined after a strong jobs report last Friday That movement also likely weighed on quantum stocks as all three companies are unprofitable and have minimal revenue As of 1116 am ET DWave Quantum was down 314 Quantum Computing 247 and Rigetti Computing had lost 255 In an interview with Rogan Zuckerberg said in response to a question on quantum computing My understanding is thats still quite a ways off from being a very useful paradigm I think Google just had some breakthrough but I think most people still think thats like a decadeplus out so my guess is that were going to have pretty smart AIs even before that Like Huang last week Zuckerberg is also throwing cold water on the idea that quantum computing is about to revolutionize the tech industry in spite of Alphabets recent research milestone DWave Quantum also reported some news of its own last Friday filing for a stock sale plan that allows it to sell up to 150 million in stock Investors tend to dislike secondary offerings as they dilute existing shareholders but raising cash when the stock price is elevated makes sense especially for a developmentstage company like DWave Also on Friday DWave announced that fiscal 2024 bookings would top 23 million up 120 from fiscal 2023 levels and Q4 bookings would be at least 18 million up 500 from the quarter a year ago CEO Alan Baratz also pushed back on Huangs narrative on CNBC saying that there are different kinds of quantum computing solutions and some are maturing faster than others He also said DWaves annealing quantum computing solutions are currently available and solving real problems Quantum Computing didnt have any news of its own to report but the company is even smaller than DWave with less than 1 million in revenue over the last four quarters Its stock has soared even higher than DWaves over the last year a disconnect that could lead to a continued decline in Quantum Computings shares Finally Rigetti Computing is the biggest of these three stocks based on trailing revenue with nearly 12 million over the last four quarters Rigetti is likely to move with its peers even if it is the largest of the three as investor perceptions of the industry are still rapidly evolving These stocks still trade at a valuation of over 1 billion which makes them very expensive for developmentstage companies and they could easily fall further DWaves financial update last week was encouraging but the stock still fell on the news showing that the sector looks overvalued after last months surge Speculative investors could take a small position in DWave or its peers but competition from Alphabet also means that success in quantum computing doesnt mean success for these stocks Id expect these sector stocks to continue to trend lower Ever feel like you missed the boat

whether the firms prediction that the new system will help to reduce costs to developers is accurate The commission and Apple declined to comment The fresh audit could eventually lead to the

Over the last several years she has earned a reputation for making overly bullish calls on companies that may typically lack the full attention of the rest of Wall Street Another aspect of Woods investment prowess that is quite uncommon is that she has Ark publish its trading activity on a daily basis With this in mind its never a question of what stocks Wood is buying or selling but why she may be doing so Toward the end of last year I started noticing some frequent purchases of GitLab NASDAQ GTLB from Arks daily trading reports If youre unaware of GitLab fear not Below Im going to break down Woods trading activity in GitLab stock and make the case for why this undertheradar artificial intelligence AI player is worth keeping on your radar In the table below Ive outlined Arks buying activity in GitLab over the past several weeks Date Shares Purchased Dec 23 78185 Dec 24 269976 Dec 31 245243 Jan 6 290710 Jan 7 162121 Data source Ark Invest Since the end of December Wood has purchased slightly more than 1 million shares of GitLab and spread the position across two of Arks exchangetraded funds ETFs ARK Innovation ETF and ARK Next Generation Internet ETF GitLab is a software platform that helps developers code identify security vulnerabilities and automate testing all in one platform The companys AI platform GitLab Duo is integrated with Amazon Q an agentic AI chatbot During GitLabs thirdquarter earnings call in early December management noted that the next evolution in AI will be agentic and agentic AI is the foundation of GitLab Duo workflow I do not see the collaboration with Amazon as coincidental Microsofts CoPilot is one of the largest agentic AI systems available right now and a big part of its success can be traced back to GitHub Remember GitHub is perhaps the most direct competitor to GitLab and became a part of Microsofts ecosystem after it was acquired for more than 7 billion back in 2018 In 2024 shares of GitLab declined by roughly 10 Considering AI fueled the SP 500 and Nasdaq Composite to new highs on numerous occasions last year its actually surprising to find a technology stock that underperformed the broader market In the table below Ive illustrated GitLabs price action between the dates that coincide with Arks purchases Given the brief selloff toward the end of the year it appears that Wood took advantage of the depressed price action and bought the dip Considering GitLabs top line is growing at more than 30 annually and the company has recently transitioned from a cashburning operation to generating positive net income I tend to think the underperformance in the stock boils down to a couple of factors such as competition and high expectations from investors While it remains much smaller than Microsofts GitHub I wouldnt discount GitLabs potential Considering the company is partnering with Amazon and specifically focusing on agentic AI I personally think GitLab is subtly positioned for much higher revenue and profit growth I think GitLab could be an interesting opportunity for investors looking for potentially highgrowth albeit volatile names in the AI realm Before you buy stock in GitLab consider this The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now and GitLab wasnt one of them The 10 stocks that made the cut

rescheduling any travel that would return them to the US on or after January 20 the date of Donald Trumps presidential inauguration the note said The fear is that Trump once in office will quickly act on his promise to upend US immigration laws Any changes could create unpredictability at ports of entry and maroon workers outside the country or cause significant delays in their return The Amazon

any international travel before Trump takes his oath of office For some workers that means delaying or cancelling vacations and trips to see family overseas leaving many anxious and uncertain about their futures Shortly after taking office in his first term Trump issued an executive order blocking the immigration of people born in seven predominantly Muslim countries The decision created immediate chaos at airports and led to visas for up to 60000 people being provisionally revoked This time around immigration is again in Trumps crosshairs and those of his supporters For example one of the temporary worker visa programs the H1B designed for skilled workers came under fire in recent weeks as Trump supporters debated whether tech companies exploit the program to prioritize lowerpaid foreign employees over hiring Americans Although Trump recently voiced support for such programs he has also promised mass deportations Well aware of Trumps unpredictability many companies are deciding to play it safe A current employee of US Bank who is from India on an H1B visa also told Fortune he had received a similar letter as Amazons from an immigration law firm engaged by the company The letter he said included advice to return to the US before January 20 and recommended reaching out to the law firm if immigration officers called him As with all anonymous sources in this article Fortune knows the workers identity Another tech employee at a different company showed Fortune a similar memo sent last month to one of his friends who also works in tech The memo which had the company name redacted highly recommended that employees who have international travel planned return to the US before the new US governments administration takes office out of an abundance of caution except for urgent situations or emergencies related to health or business matters The letter provided under the condition of anonymity because it was a confidential document also recommended that employees delay unnecessary travel during the Trump administrations first few months The letter said we do not want to cause any undue alarm but considering the possibility of a travel ban it would be prudent to allow for a bit of time for the new administration to take office and to let the dust settle Other foreign tech workers who went to US universities have received warnings from their alma maters A letter from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst recommended that its international communityincluding all international students scholars and faculty and staff whose immigration status is sponsored by the schoolto strongly consider returning to the United States prior to the presidential inauguration day if they are traveling internationally The universitys letter acknowledged that its warning isnt based on any current US government policy or recommendation But it continued by saying that given a new presidential administration can enact new policies on their first day in office January 20 and based on previous experience with travel bans that were enacted in the first Trump Administration in 2016 the Office of Global Affairs is making this advisory out of an abundance of caution to hopefully prevent any possible travel disruption to members of our international community Poonam Gupta a New Yorkbased immigration lawyer who advises Big Tech employees says the travel advice in the letters obtained by Fortune align with what she has been advising her clients since the presidential election results were announced in November We anticipate a few executive orders to be issued on January 20 and while they may not be directed we hope towards the work visas there is always impact across the board she wrote in an email And it is not just Big Tech companies but also small employers that are advising foreign individuals to complete all travels before January 20 said Natalia Polukhtin an immigration attorney in Scottsdale Ariz Shes advised corporate clients about how to warn potentially impacted employees We anticipate rapid shifts in US policies that may result in the denial of entry at the border Polukhtin told Fortune in an email With something similar to the Muslim ban enacted through the executive order during the prior Trumps Administration it is very feasible that citizens of undesirable countries may be locked out of the US even with perfectly valid travel documents The warnings from companies reviewed by Fortune made no distinction between temporary work visas such as H1Bs or green cards for permanent residents The email Amazon sent to impacted employees had a subject line saying Holiday Travel Guidelines for Foreign Nationals and opened with an explanation saying you are receiving this message as our team has previously provided you with immigration support The subject appears to be a sensitive one for companies Amazon did not respond to a request for comment nor did Google Meanwhile Nvidia and Microsoft declined to comment Not all companies are sending travel guidance to workers who are foreign nationals Sourav Bhattacharyya an Indian national who works for a large Pittsburghbased technology consulting firm under an H1B visa said that he needs to travel to Europe in March as part of a required course to complete his executive MBA When he asked his companys immigration legal team about any concerns about the trip he was told there is no official travel advisory Still Bhattacharyya is worried Who knows if President Trump tries to impose a travel ban or ask the Department of Homeland security to increase scrutiny at the POEs Ports of Entry across the country While returning back to the US we might end up facing needless hassle he said Sathyaraj Radhakrishnan another Indian national who works in AI and analytics for consulting firm Cognizant on an H1B visa also said he had not received a travel advisory from his employer But hes taking his precautions anyway His father had surgery last week in India but because of the possibility of Trumps signing new executive orders on immigration he said he is avoiding travel for at least a month Although India was not one of the countries affected by the 2017 ban I would rather have things settle down before I make concrete plans Radhakrishnan added This story was originally featured on Fortunecom A photo shared by Vice

Inflationary Jitters Resurge US inflation data will provide a major test for the recent runup in Treasury yields and investors tempered expectations for Fed rate cuts this year The December Consumer Price Index CPI due on Wednesday is expected to show a 03 monthly rise according to a Reuters poll following a similar rise in the CPI in the prior month For investors the pace of inflation is one of the main risk factors At its December meeting the Fed projected only two rate cuts this year as it braced for higher inflation than it had previously estimated Market expectations are baking in about 40 basis points bps of easing in 2025 A hot inflation number could further lift Treasury yields whose swift ascent in recent weeks has rattled asset prices 2 Big Banks Kickoff Q4 Earnings Robust

relevant results Sign in to access your portfolio","Shopify NYSE SHOP has arguably become the most prominent USbased ecommerce stock behind Amazon A fast easytouse sales site and an extensive ecosystem helped it stand out above most other ecommerce platforms While the stock experienced modest gains over the last year it has risen nearly 300 from its bear market lows in 2022 Despite those healthy gains it sells at more than a 40 discount from its alltime high set in 2021 Considering the state of its business and financials the question of whether Shopify stock is a buy sell or hold likely warrants a deeper dive At this point in Shopifys history it appears to have moved on from a mistake earlier in the decade that likely compounded the stocks huge pullback in 2022 The decision to create an ecosystem of services for online merchants has served it well on balance Addons such as payment services online marketing and sales tracking have allowed Shopify to drive added revenue from its existing customer base So successful is this approach that 72 of the companys revenue in the first nine months of 2024 came from this merchant services segment Nonetheless it likely took merchant services too far when it started the Shopify Fulfillment Network SFN Aside from the fact that fulfillment and shipping are far outside its core software business such a business also involves massive fixed costs Consequently those costs made Shopify a moneyloser after having recently turned profitable Seeing the effects on the overall business Shopify sold the SFN Although it still exists in name a company called Flexport owns and manages that part of the operation That has given Shopify the best of both worlds giving its customers fulfillment services while allowing the company to return to profitability Also helping Shopify is the outlook for the ecommerce industry To that end Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate CAGR for the ecommerce industry of 19 through 2030 If that prediction is anywhere close to coming true it should bode well for Shopifys revenue and ultimately its stock performance for years to come As mentioned before the stock still trades at a considerable discount from its record high Unfortunately for investors its growth rate slowed significantly over the last decade making a recovery more challenging In the first nine months of 2024 Shopifys 61 billion in revenue rose 23 from yearago levels While impressive it lags the 47 revenue growth rate in the first three quarters of 2019 before the pandemic Nonetheless as mentioned before Shopify now has something it did not have in 2019 a positive net income Its 726 million in profit in the first three quarters of 2024 is up from the 525 million loss in the same yearago period Moreover even though analysts predict a 23 revenue growth rate in 2025 it could spark a more significant growth in net income that could take its stock price growth higher The valuation metrics offer a more mixed picture Its PE ratio is 97 and even when looking at the pricetosales PS ratio it is still at a relatively high 16 times revenue Still Amazon routinely sold at a higher PE ratio in its growth phase implying Shopify could sustain such an earnings multiple Additionally Shopify stock often sold for above 40 times sales during the pandemic so its sales multiple is still far below record highs This indicates improving financials and expanding multiples could still take Shopify stock higher in the foreseeable future Under current conditions Shopify stock should remain a buy Admittedly the rising valuation and the slowing growth in recent years might turn investors cautious and for that reason new buyers should consider a dollarcost averaging approach to buying However Shopify has become one of the most impactful online shopping platforms in both the US and the world and the ecommerce industry is on track for continued growth for at least the rest of the decade That should bode well for investors and could spark a continued recovery in the stock that takes it back to its record highs and beyond Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks Then

Change is perhaps the only certainty on Wall Street Due to factors such as innovation competition mergers and acquisitions bankruptcies and legal judgments the puzzle pieces that make up the largest publicly traded companies are constantly in flux When 2004 came to a close ExxonMobil was the largest publicly traded company in the SP 500 with Citigroup and General Electric also in the top 10 Today Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT is the only member of the endof2004 top 10 thats still among Americas largest publicly traded companies Since the midpoint of 2023 weve witnessed Apple NASDAQ AAPL Microsoft and semiconductor colossus Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA all surpass the 3 trillion valuation plateau Although Nvidia would seem like the surest bet to reach the psychologically important 5 trillion level given the rise of artificial intelligence AI a darkhorse candidate may have the clearest path to become Wall Streets first 5 trillion company On one hand theres no denying that Nvidia has enjoyed a textbook operating expansion The companys Hopper H100 graphics processing units GPUs and successor Blackwell chips have been the preferred options for businesses wanting to run generative AI solutions and train large language models in their highcompute data centers With demand for GPUs overwhelming supply Nvidia has been able to command 30000 to 40000 for its Hopper chip which is up to four times as much as Advanced Micro Devices has charged customers for its Instinct MI300X GPU Having otherworldly pricing power helped to push Nvidias gross margin to as high as 784 last year While the longterm outlook for AI remains encouraging and this technology has realworld applications in most industries around the globe Nvidias chances of becoming Wall Streets first 5 trillion company are likely going to be thwarted by history Roughly three decades ago the internet began going mainstream and offered businesses a new way to connect with potential customers Though the internet did eventually alter the growth trajectory for corporate America is a positive way it took years before businesses really understood how to harness these new sales and marketing channels Including the internet every gamechanging technology or innovation for 30 years has navigated its way through an early stage bubble In simpler terms investors have consistently overestimated how quickly a new technologyinnovation would be adopted or gain widespread utility With most companies lacking clear game plans as to how theyll maximize the return on their AI investments it sets artificial intelligence up to be the next in a long line of bubbles Since no company has benefited more directly from the AI revolution than Nvidia the logical expectation is that its stock would be hit the hardest Historic precedent makes it unlikely that Nvidia ascends to a 5 trillion valuation first If history were to rhyme and the AI bubble bursts it would also be bad news for Microsoft which has been investing heavily in an artificial intelligencedriven future Although Microsofts operating cash flow isnt as overwhelmingly reliant on AI as Nvidia being the first to reach a 5 trillion valuation would be a stretch The same can be said for Wall Streets other 3 trillion public company Apple Though Apples Services segment continues to grow by a doubledigit percentage its physical device sales including iPhone have stagnated for two years Apple stock is already trading at one of its priciest valuations in a decade which leaves little room for its valuation to rise by another 14 trillion The Magnificent Seven component that

marketplace Last February eMarketer estimated that Amazon would account for just over 40 of US online retail sales in 2024 While this online retail platform has been the face of Amazon for nearly three decades ecommerce plays a minimal role in terms of cash flow generation and operating income The lions share of Amazons growth potential specifically growth in cash flow originates from its ancillary operating segments with Amazon Web Services AWS at the front of the pack Based on data from techanalysis firm Canalys AWS is the worlds leading cloud infrastructure service platform with an estimated 33 share of total cloud spending during the third quarter of 2024 For context Amazons share of spending among cloudservice providers is more than Microsofts Azure and Alphabets Google Cloud combined and these are the Nos 2 and 3 in global cloudservice spending Even though AI has played a role in AWSs growth enterprise spending on cloud services was growing at a steady doubledigit pace long before AI became the hottest thing since sliced bread on Wall Street With enterprise cloudservice spending still in its relatively early stages of expansion Amazon can expect substantially higher margins from this segment to meaningfully boost its cash flow Beyond AWS Amazons advertising services and subscription services eg Prime segments are also respectively growing by double digits Amazons push into exclusive sporting events Thursday Night Football and NBA streaming packages should improve demand for advertising as well as support its subscription pricing power The key point is that unlike Microsoft and Nvidia Amazon wouldnt be dragged down by the AI bubble bursting thanks to its abundance of other catalysts Lastly Amazon remains historically inexpensive Throughout the 2010s investors willingly paid 23 to 37 times yearend cash flow to own shares of the company But as of the closing bell on Jan 10 Amazons shares are valued at just 135 times consensus cash flow for 2026 If Amazon were to reach the median yearend multiple to cash flow it traded at consistently from 2010 through 2019 it would become Wall Streets first 5 trillion company Ever feel like you missed the boat

in the bank but dont own any stocks you might consider entering the market today to maximize your longterm gains After all the SP 500 has delivered average annual total returns of more than 10 since its inception in 1957 and it could maintain that momentum for the foreseeable future But with the market now hovering near its alltime highs investors might be reluctant to buy new stocks as many have high valuations So today Ill highlight three oftoverlooked tech stocks that still arent too expensive relative to their longterm growth potential DigitalOcean NYSE DOCN Oracle NYSE ORCL and Dell Technologies NYSE DELL DigitalOcean is a cloud infrastructure company that serves up cheaper droplets of servers for small businesses and independent developers That unique strategy helped it carve out a niche in a market that was dominated by enterpriseoriented cloud giants like Amazon and Microsoft From 2018 to 2023 DigitalOceans revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 28 It also turned profitable in 2023 From 2023 to 2026 analysts expect its revenue and EPS to rise at a CAGR of 13 and 85 respectively As DigitalOcean continued growing in the shadow of its larger cloud competitors and it increased its exposure to the booming AI market by acquiring the startup Paperspace in 2023 and adding its GPUpowered servers to its platform It could have plenty of room to run as its niche market expands but its stock still looks reasonably valued at 40 times forward earnings Oracle is one of the worlds largest database software companies Over the past decade it expanded its cloudbased infrastructure and software services to pivot away from its onsite applications It also acquired a lot of companies including the cloud giant NetSuite and the healthcare IT leader Cerner to accelerate that evolution From fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2024 which ended in May 2024 Oracles revenue and EPS grew at a CAGR of 6 and 5 respectively But from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 analysts expect its revenue and EPS to rise at a CAGR of 12 and 21 respectively That acceleration will likely be driven by the generative AI market which is driving more companies to run their AI workloads on its Gen 2 cloud infrastructure platform Its stock isnt too expensive at 29 times forward earnings and its committed to returning a lot of its free cash flows to its investors through dividends and buybacks Its forward dividend yield of 08 isnt too impressive but its bought back more than a third of its shares over the past decade Dell was taken private back in 2013 after it diworsified its business with too many messy acquisitions but it returned to the public market as a more streamlined company in 2018 Today its still one of the worlds largest producers of PCs and servers From fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2024 which ended in February 2024 Dells annual revenue actually declined That drop was caused by its spinoff of Vmware in 2021 and a sluggish PC market But from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 analysts expect its revenue and EPS to rise at a CAGR of 8 and 24 respectively as the PC market stabilizes and its AI server business expands In its latest quarterly report Dell COO Jeff Clarke called AI a robust opportunity for the company with no signs of slowing down So while Dell might be growing as rapidly as Nvidia or other more popular AI companies it still looks like a dirt cheap play on that market at 12 times forward earnings It also pays a forward yield of 13 Before you buy stock in DigitalOcean consider this The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe

move from its prior days close Tip Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results Sign in to access your portfolio","Tip Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results Just a year ago the SP 500 SNPINDEX GSPC confirmed its presence in a bull market and went on to reach multiple record highs throughout 2024 Optimism about a lower interest rate environment ahead and the potential of artificial intelligence AI to revolutionize many industries drove the gains and investors piled into stocks that might benefit the most from all of this including growth and AI players Theres reason to believe this positive momentum could continue as the Federal Reserve has launched initial rate cuts and AI companies are benefiting from their investments Still at the start of this new year investors remain somewhat cautious leaving the SP 500 little changed so far Concern remains that interest rates wont decline as quickly as some have expected and this could weigh on companies households and the stock market in general So its logical to wonder whether the SP 500 will decline in 2025 after two years of gains To offer us a clue lets take a look at what history says and consider how to prepare for whats ahead First its important to note that the SP 500 is an excellent measure to refer to because it includes the top 500 companies that power the economy And its particularly relevant since it periodically adds and deletes players according to certain factors such as their market value and earnings performance So the SP 500 is able to maintain its status as an accurate reflection of the major companies of the times Now lets see what history tells us about the SP 500s performance track record Over the past 40 years every period of gains that started with an annual increase in the double digits was followed by at least two more consecutive winning years If the SP 500 follows this historical pattern it wont be heading for a decline this year but instead another year of gains The index started this new period of gains with a 24 increase in 2023 This is great news but its still a good idea to remain somewhat cautious Though history can be an accurate guide this isnt always the case The market and individual stocks have been known to surprise us making it impossible to predict future performance with 100 certainty All this means that we have reason to be optimistic about the stock market in 2025 but at the same time we should remain ready for surprises too Now the big question is how should we as investors prepare for both scenarios Well the fantastic news is that by focusing on the long term you can both maximize your returns in winning markets and minimize your losses in difficult times So the first thing to do right now is to make sure youre invested only in stocks that have solid longterm prospects No matter what the market does this year youre likely to win over time with this sort of investment Im talking about stocks that have solid earnings track records and a distinct roadmap for future growth A company like Amazon NASDAQ AMZN is a good example Its progressively grown its earnings into the billions of dollars thanks to its dominance in the highgrowth areas of ecommerce and cloud computing Amazon today has outlined how its boosting earnings through use of AI and other tools to gain in efficiency and the companys cloud business investment in AI is supercharging revenue growth there Amazon Web Services AWS reached a 110 billion annual revenue run rate last year thanks to its AI products and services Another key move for investors today is to pick up a couple of dividend stocks especially those with a track record of increasing and paying out dividends over the years For this we can turn to a Dividend King like CocaCola NYSE KO These companies have shown that rewarding investors is important to them and they have the financial strength to keep this going I love dividends because they offer you passive income no matter what the market is doing and that can add up over time Finally the third thing you can do today to prepare for any market situation ahead is ensuring your portfolio is diversified This way if one particular stock or industry that youve invested in suffers other holdings may limit declines And by investing in various stocks and sectors youre multiplying your chances for a victory Today history offers us reason to be excited about 2025 suggesting that the SP 500 is likely to soar as its done in previous periods But even if it doesnt by taking the steps Ive mentioned your portfolio still could advance this year and most importantly over the long run Before you buy stock in Amazon consider this The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified

in the London boroughs of Hackney Westminster and Islington The new service which is part of a wider effort to cut carbon emissions from Amazons fleet of delivery vans means staff will cross paths with postal workers employed by the 509yearold Royal Mail Nicola Fyfe of Amazon Logistics said the business would consider expanding its onfoot deliveries to other UK cities if it proved a success She said When you look at the onfoot walker deliveries and couple them up with our electric bike deliveries and our electric vans the three of them working together really helps bring a sustainable delivery solution These three forms of zeroemission delivery now cover 70pc of Londons Congestion Charge zone Amazon said Ms Fyfe said it also helped when planning deliveries in pedestrianised zones and lowtraffic networks Amazon has also expanded its deliveries by electric cargo bike to Belfast and Norwich joining London Manchester and Glasgow The technology giant has said it is investing 300m in cutting emissions from its UK delivery operations As part of this Amazon said it would start transporting more packages by rail in Britain beginning with the fullyelectric West Coast Main Line between Scotland and the Midlands Products will be unloaded from train carriages and sorted at local delivery centres Royal Mail ended its night mail train service last year The company also confirmed its largest ever order of electric HGVs on Tuesday which will include 140 electric Mercedes Benz haulers and eight Volvo trucks Its trucks will have a range of 310 miles on a full charge The vehicles will expand Amazons fleet of green trucks to around 160 The order of electric trucks is a record for any company in the UK Amazon said it expected the green transport to carry 300m packages each year once it is operational It will also install fastchargers at key points in its logistic network that can boost the batteries of its trucks from 20pc to 80pc in an hour The companys launch of onfoot deliveries in the UK follows similar trials in New York and Paris where it has used peoplepower to avoid congestion and meet demands for next day and same day deliveries from customers While it is a customer of the postal service Amazon has a sprawling logistics division for deliveries from its Amazoncom site It is also growing its shipping arm which collects parcels from retailers directly and delivers them to customers rather than sending them from a central fulfilment centre Despite being Britains biggest parcel company Royal Mail has been grappling with a longterm decline in letter deliveries and a growing challenge from companies such as Evri and Amazon in parcels amid soaring demand for online shopping since the pandemic Its postmen walk up to 1bn steps every day and half of the Royal Mails routes are largely on foot with twothirds of packages still delivered by legwork Alexander Paterson an analyst at Peel Hunt said Royal Mail risked losing business to Amazon He said Royal Mail has very high fixed costs and low margins even in good years and is therefore very highly operationally geared If Amazon was to roll out its own delivery service in areas of high population density and high numbers of parcels per address it would present challenges for Royal Mail Last year the Government gave the green light to a 36bn takeover of Royal Mail by Czech tycoon Daniel Kretinsky The postal service is also pushing for an overhaul of its universal service obligation which requires it to deliver letters six days a week Royal Mail is planning to trial a reduced service this year that will see some areas deprived of secondclass letter deliveries on Saturdays Regulator Ofcom is expected to launch a consultation on the proposals in the coming weeks Broaden your

with a focus on trucks At this point it really makes two types of vehicles a highend consumer model and work trucks for business customers On the business side it counts Amazon NASDAQ AMZN as a key partner This relationship has been an important one for Rivian as it is a statement to the quality of its products That said Rivian has won a host of awards for its consumer oriented vehicles as well It isnt easy breaking into a developed industry like autos but Rivian seems like it is finding at least reasonable success in its efforts For example it has gone from producing no cars to around 50000 a year Thats way less than established competitors like Tesla and certainly industry giants like Ford but it is a large enough figure to benefit from economies of scale That in fact was the focus in 2024 Up until 2023 Rivian was working to build out its manufacturing assets Once it achieved that goal it set about trying to work down its costs so it could make its vehicles profitably That included shutting down its factory to retool and implement other changes that would allow for lower manufacturing costs over time There is an important nuance here however Rivians big financial goal for 2024 is to generate a modest gross profit in the fourth quarter That basically means that the cost of manufacturing a vehicle is more than paid for by the revenue generated from the sale of that vehicle It is an important step toward profitability but it doesnt mean Rivian is generating earnings because there are other expenses to consider below the gross profit line in the earnings statement At the end of the third quarter the company claimed it was still on track for a modest gross profit in the fourth quarter Only there was a fly in the ointment when it came to achieving this goal After the factory restart Rivian faced parts shortages that forced it to lower its fullyear production targets Thats not a good thing but management was able to shift gears and lean on its relationship with Amazon to keep production going where it could while it dealt with the issue When the company released its fullyear 2024 production numbers it announced that the parts problem had been solved No business operates in a straight line There are always problems to deal with and being able to successfully do that is an important skill Rivian has shown it has that skill which should make investors a little more comfortable owning the stock But the real takeaway is that on Feb 20 it seems likely that Rivian will announce a modest gross profit And even if it doesnt this key development will likely come in early 2025 This is a notable turning point for the business that investors shouldnt ignore Rivians stock has fallen dramatically from its alltime highs But it probably isnt reasonable to expect a return to those levels given the changed thinking about EVs on Wall Street Still as this company continues to march forward in its ultimate goal to become a profitable EV maker it seems likely that the shares could rise materially from where they are today And the February quarterly earnings update will be an important one in that trek Look for an update on the gross profit line and

company by market capitalization The rising demand for artificial intelligence AI has put the computer chip maker in overdrive with profits gushing However with a pricetoearnings ratio above 50 and profit margins expanded to much higher levels than its historical average I dont think 2025 is a great year to bet on Nvidia There are cheaper stocks to buy if you want to play the AI trend boom Enter Amazon NASDAQ AMZN The technology giants stock has barely beat the SP 500 in the last five years with most of these gains coming in the first year of the COVID19 pandemic Heres why it can accelerate growth and finish 2025 as the stock with the largest market cap in the world Amazons largest profit driver is Amazon Web Services AWS the leading cloud computing infrastructure company in the world AWS is one of the largest buyers of Nvidia chips It builds the data centers that run the powerhungry AI tools that are growing like a weed In the last few quarters AWS revenue growth has accelerated starting at 12 yearoveryear growth in Q2 2023 and finishing Q3 of 2024 with 19 yearoveryear growth Its annualized revenue run rate is now over 100 billion Perhaps more impressive are the profit margins that AWS sports Trailing12month operating margin was 35 translating to 36 billion in operating income from the segment As AI demand grows in 2025 I think that AWS can keep accelerating its revenue growth If revenue can grow by 25 in 2025 that would bring overall revenue to around 130 billion for AWS With a 35 profit margin this equates to 455 billion in operating income from the segment On a longer time scale there is still a long runway for AWS to grow As management likes to mention the majority of IT spending still remains onpremise and is currently transitioning to cloud computing infrastructure As this trend continues AWS will take more of the IT dollars that have switched from legacy spending leading to sustained revenue growth Lets not forget about Amazons massive retail empire The ecommerce subscription and advertising business is doing 377 billion in revenue just in North America with 140 billion in more revenue coming from other countries International segments will likely contribute little to profitability in 2025 due to investments in newer markets such as India North American profits should continue to climb though Profit margins for North American retail have gone from close to 0 in 2023 to 6 over the last 12 months With highmargin segments such as advertising growing at 19 year over year Amazon has plenty of room to expand its profit margins for North American retail yet again in 2025 If this margin expansion continues I would expect the segment to finish 2025 with 10 profit margins if not higher This is not a high hurdle for the company to surpass either If the North America segment can grow to over 400 billion in revenue a 10 profit margin means over 40 billion in operating income for the segment This excludes the international retail segment which still has a long runway to grow in Europe India and other markets If Amazon can achieve these financial results this year its consolidated operating earnings should reach around 100 billion This would be a huge jump from the 60 billion it generated over the last 12 months With the long runway to grow at AWS and further potential for margin expansion in North American retail I would expect Amazons profits to continue growing at a rapid pace over the next few years meaning that investors will assign it a premium earning multiple as has been the case historically Assuming Amazon will trade at around 40 times its 2025 operating income the stock will finish the year with a market cap close to 4 trillion This would put it ahead of the current leaders today in Nvidia Apple and Microsoft As long as these three companies dont have blockbuster years from a financial standpoint I think Amazon can come from behind and retake its lead as the largest company in the world when

REOs auctions and FSBOs Read Next I Made 10000 Using One of Dave Ramseys Best Passive Income Ideas As most people behind multilevel marketing schemes will tell you they are not pyramid schemes Pyramidscheme adjacent sure but technically not pyramid schemes Multilevel marketing is the system made famous by companies like Herbalife In this system a company relies heavily on a salesforce working entirely on commission Not only do those people sell the products but they also recruit their own team of salespeople and collect a cut of the commissions from anyone they bring on Theres potential money to be made for an enterprising salesperson whos good with people and can recruit a team to sell under them just be aware that the key difference between this and a pure pyramid scheme is the product itself If actual consumers are buying and using what youre selling its a multilevel marketing scheme If the vast majority of the product is sitting in boxes in the garages of salespeople well its not Even if the company is not a pyramid scheme its worth noting that relatively few people earn meaningful incomes through multilevel marketing according to Investopedia Because multilevel marketing is always dependent on recruiting new sellers its easy to get started Companies like Herbalife Amway and Avon allow you to sign up to sell their products via their respective websites Although its easy to get started selling its not such an easy road to turn a profit For example a Federal Trade Commission investigation into Herbalife that ended with a 200 million settlement in 2016 found that a large majority of distributors made little or no money and a substantial percentage lost money CBS News reported So think twice before you sign up as a distributor for any of these companies Credit card churning refers to the practice of opening new credit cards specifically to get signup bonuses and rewards Once you charge enough on the card to get the reward typically you have to spend a certain amount within the first 90 days of opening you stop using the card This practice can come with some risk especially if youre charging more than you can afford to pay back in full each month but if done correctly you can swipe your way to free cashback bonuses and travel rewards Signup bonuses are always changing so visit the sites of the major credit card companies to see which cards are offering the largest bonuses at the moment You should start small with two or three cards at most and do not open any new cards until you have paid the balances off the cards you open Make sure to read the fine print some credit card issuers set limits on how many cards you can open with them in a certain time period Its also important to keep your spending in check and only charge what you can afford to pay back in full Otherwise the interest you end up owing could negate any cash back or rewards you earned by opening the card In addition to potentially racking up debt another risk with credit card churning is that it can hurt your credit score because applying for a card generally counts as a hard inquiry Multiple hard inquiries in a short period of time could cause your credit score to drop so keep this in mind if you plan on applying for a home car or other loans Joel Anderson contributed to the reporting for this article More From

from a drone zooming through the sky is becoming a reality Wing a drone delivery venture owned by Google parent Alphabet GOOG GOOGL has been building its operations since 2012 Its drones have made more than 400000 deliveries in the US Europe and Australia The company is currently testing its services in Texas Virginia and at a facility in California One of the biggest misconceptions about drone delivery and nextgen aviation is that its some faroff future technology Wing CEO Adam Woodworth told Yahoo Finance in an exclusive interview The reality is that this is happening every day Our recent partnership with DoorDash and Brookfield Property is a testament to that The drones cruise at a height of about 150 feet and travel roughly 65 miles per hour They have a wingspan of 49 feet and length of 43 feet The fleet rests at charging stations called nests and one flies to a store when an order comes in The drone while hovering lowers a tether so an employee can attach the product inside a box Then the cord is reeled up and off the drone goes The orders can be tracked by customers in real time and the drone lowers its tether and unclips the item once it arrives Wings business partners pay the company a fee per delivery Wing partnered with Walmart WMT in August 2023 and DoorDash DASH in December 2024 to deliver to customers within proximity of its nests The company said the average flight time from stores to homes has been about 3 minutes and 24 seconds We see drone delivery at scale looking more like an efficient rideshare network than a traditional transportation system Woodworth said We believe the drone is just the vehicle and its only as useful as the software and logistics networks that make it meaningful for organizations and their customers There are restrictions however Deliveries can only take place during the day typically between 10 am and 6 pm to avoid the dark The drones can only travel up to 12 miles roundtrip and the items they carry cannot exceed 25 pounds Customers are mostly ordering what Woodworth calls forgotten goods Those oopsie moments when you get home from the store and realize limes never made it into your shopping cart Woodworth said Within minutes you can have that delivered right to your door According to Woodworth Wing delivered 554 limes in the DallasFort Worth area in 2024 enough to make 700 margaritas We have a lot of customer stickiness Woodworth said pointing to company data that customers order at least twice a week once they experience drone deliveries JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a December research note While Wing doesnt get as much attention from investors among Other Bets businesses wWaymo most frequently discussed we believe Wing could become the 3rd OB business to raise outside capital should it continue reaching progress milestones Anmuth maintained an Overweight rating on Alphabet raising the firms price target to 232 from 212 an increase of nearly 20 Googles accelerated pace of innovation is very evident into the new year with many significant recent product announcements and updates and it is a key factor in our positive view on Google shares in 2025 he wrote Moor Insights and Strategy analyst Anshel Sag is also bullish on Google but says its still early days for Wing This shows that the company is more diverse than a lot of its competitors and it continues to create new and interesting ways to grow its business Sag told Yahoo Finance Wing has to be extremely costsensitive even more so than Waymo he added The cost sensitivity is way higher when its a B2B transaction because the consumer most likely wont even know whos delivering it Googles not alone in the unmanned aerial vehicle space Amazons AMZN drone delivery service called Prime Air launched its new MK30 drones in 2022 and recently received regulatory approval to fly them Walmart also has a large drone delivery footprint UPS UPS has been operating a fleet of drones for package deliveries There are also several startups in the space such as Zipline Flytrex and Matternet According to Woodworth Wing aims to make drone delivery an established part of the delivery ecosystem available to customers nationwide by 2035 A report by market research firm Mordor Intelligence estimated the drone delivery market size will reach 830 million this year and rise to 209 billion by 2030 Woodworth joined Wing in 2014 as a hardware engineer and served as the companys chief technology officer before becoming CEO in 2022 Project Wing began as an idea under Alphabets research lab that focuses on moonshot projects known as X Alphabets other bets businesses that have raised capital include Waymo Verily Intrinsic and Isomorphic Labs While Woodworth declined to comment on Wings financials analysts told Yahoo Finance its clear Wing is part of a broader transportation vision at Google The business took investments from ZEBOX Ventures and X Development at the incubator stage but has yet to raise another round according to Pitchbook A future capital raise would be a sign that they feel like they are ready for an expansion Sag said Theyve been around for a while it feels like the next

Tesla NASDAQ TSLA and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN have been very rewarding longterm investments but the hedge fund billionaires listed below bought Tesla and sold Amazon in the third quarter Louis Bacon of Moore Capital Management bought 25000 shares of Tesla increasing his position by 19 He also sold 616475 shares of Amazon reducing his position by 76 Israel Englander of Millennium Management bought 225760 shares of Tesla increasing his position by 51 He also sold 79 million shares of Amazon reducing his position by 87 Dan Loeb of Third Point bought 400000 shares of Tesla starting a new position He also sold 14 million shares of Amazon reducing his position by 27 Chris Rokos at Rokos Capital Management bought 100000 shares of Tesla starting a new position He also sold 755165 shares of Amazon reducing his position by 39 Importantly while tracking the stocks hedge fund managers hold can provide inspiration the trades listed above happened in the third quarter which ended over three months ago and the fourthquarter update will not be available until midFebruary So heres a more current look at Tesla and Amazon Tesla shares fell sharply on Jan 2 when the company reported 495570 fourthquarter deliveries about 10000 units short of the consensus estimate But the stock rebounded the next day on reports of strong sales in China and an upgrade from Canaccord Importantly while Tesla led the market in electric car sales through November its market share has declined across all three of its major markets US Europe and China Tesla has a few important catalysts on the horizon that could lead to upward revisions in earnings estimates which may send shares higher First it plans to launch a sub30000 vehicle reportedly called the Model Q in the first half of 2025 Second touting a 1000fold improvement in its full selfdriving FSD software this year Tesla plans to launch an unsupervised version of the software in California and Texas next year Additionally Tesla plans to launch an autonomous ridesharing service in California and Texas in 2025 and potentially other states too according to CEO Elon Musk That could be an inflection point for the business Musk has previously estimated robotaxis could push Teslas gross margin to 70 or higher Comparatively its gross margin was about 20 in the most recent quarter Wall Street expects Teslas adjusted earnings to increase 26 over the next four quarters That makes its current valuation of 164 times adjusted earnings look outrageously expensive But not all Wall Street analysts are pessimistic Dan Ives at Wedbush on Nov 29 said Today I view Tesla as the most undervalued AI name on the market Personally I think the hedge funds that bought Tesla in the third quarter were making a bet on Donald Trump winning the presidential election I would not be surprised if many sold down their positions during the fourth quarter especially since the stock has skyrocketed postelection Having said that investors that are confident Tesla can disrupt the mobility and transportation industries should own a longterm position Amazon has three growth engines in ecommerce digital advertising and public cloud services The company not only has a strong position in those markets but also its using artificial intelligence AI to generate more revenue and improve efficiency across all three business segments For instance Amazon operates the most visited online marketplace in the world and it supports its merchants with a vast logistics network Machine learning models informed by mountains of shopper data make product recommendations to improve sales on the marketplace They also optimize inventory and delivery routes to make logistics more efficient Amazon is the thirdlargest ad tech company as measured by sales and its gaining market share so quickly it could take second place from Meta Platforms before 2030 according to eMarketer Machine learning models informed by marketplace data help brands target ad campaigns and generative AI helps brands create media content for those campaigns Finally Amazon Web Services AWS is the largest public cloud as measured by revenue from infrastructure and platform services Its 31 market share nearly equals the 33 market share Microsoft and Alphabet have combined CEO Andy Jassy recently said In the last 18 months AWS has released nearly twice as many machine learning and generative AI features as the other leading cloud providers combined Wall Street anticipates Amazons adjusted earnings will increase 26 over the next four quarters That makes the current valuation of 46 times adjusted earnings look reasonable For that reason I think the hedge fund billionaires that sold Amazon in the third quarter made a mistake Indeed the stock trades at 219 per share today which 10 above its thirdquarter high of 200 per share and 36 above its thirdquarter low of 161 per share Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks Then youll

the gains in the SP 500 SNPINDEX GSPC during that period The company is now worth 34 trillion and should continue to benefit from the artificial intelligence AI boom for many years to come But public clouds may take the momentum lead in 2025 Investments in AI infrastructure made in the last two years position cloud computing companies to benefit as businesses turn AI prototypes into products this year That leaves room for Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and Alphabet NASDAQ GOOGL NASDAQ GOOG to surpass Nvidias current market value before the end of 2025 Amazon is currently worth 23 trillion The stock would need to return 52 for its market value to reach 35 trillion That implies a share price of 338 Alphabet is currently worth 24 trillion The stock would need to return 46 for its market value to reach 35 trillion That implies a share price of 283 Admittedly both predictions are aggressive But Bloomberg Intelligence estimates generative AI spending will grow 71 in 2025 and Wall Street may be underestimating how much Amazon and Alphabet will benefit Amazon reported solid financial results in the third quarter beating expectations on the top and bottom lines Revenue increased 11 to 159 billion on especially strong sales growth in cloud and advertising services Operating margin expanded 5 percentage points to 98 and nonGAAP generally accepted accounting principles earnings soared 52 to 143 per diluted share Analysts expected earnings to grow 21 Amazon could continue to exceed estimates as artificial intelligence AI spending increases Amazon Web Services AWS accounted for 31 of public cloud services spending in the third quarter nearly as much as the 33 market share Microsoft and Alphabet had combined That scale is a key advantage With more customers and partners AWS is better positioned to monetize AI However Amazon is also investing aggressively in AI product development Its custom AI chips Trainium and Inferentia provide a cheaper alternative to Nvidia graphics processing units GPUs Its Bedrock platform enables developers to finetune pretrained large language models and build generative AI applications And its conversational assistant Amazon Q helps programmers code test and deploy software Wall Street estimates Amazons earnings will increase 26 over the next four quarters That consensus makes the current valuation of 47 times earnings look very reasonable But the companys earnings could grow more quickly as demand for cloud AI services increases In turn that may justify a higher valuation and push the companys market value to 35 trillion For instance if Amazons earnings grow 35 in the next four quarters and shares trade at 54 times earnings below its peak of 62 times earnings in the past year its share price would increase 52 and its market value would reach 35 trillion However Amazon is a worthwhile longterm investment even if the company fails to surpass Nvidias current market value by the end of 2025 Alphabet reported encouraging financial results in the third quarter beating estimates on the top and bottom lines Revenue increased 15 to 88 billion on especially strong sales growth in Google Cloud and modest growth in Google services advertising Meanwhile GAAP net income increased 37 to 212 per diluted share Analysts expected earnings to grow 19 Alphabet may continue to top estimates as demand for AI cloud services increases Google Cloud gained 2 percentage points of market share in the past year while Microsoft lost 3 percentage points And Googles investments in AI product development may keep that trend in motion Importantly Google is the only company besides Amazon to deploy custom AI chips at scale according to New Street Research More broadly Google has a strong position in several AI product categories Forrester Research recently recognized its leadership in AI infrastructure solutions machine learning platforms and foundational large language models In one report analyst Mike Gualtieri called Google the hyperscaler best positioned for AI and said the company offers enough differentiation that it may win clients from other public clouds Wall Street estimates Alphabets earnings will increase 14 in the next four quarters which makes its current valuation of 26 times earnings look fair But generative AI spending could lead to aboveconsensus earnings and the valuation multiple could expand once investors have more clarity on the outcome of the antitrust case involving Google Search later this year Collectively those tailwinds could help Alphabet surpass Nvidias current market value by the end of 2025 For instance if earnings increase 25 over the next four quarters and the stock trades at 30 times earnings when that period ends its share price would advance

GPUs are powerful chips that were originally designed to speed up graphics rendering in video games but later became used for other applications after Nvidia created a software platform to allow developers to program its chips for other purposes However a number of large tech companies have also started to use custom AI chips or ASICs application specific integrated circuits ASICs are custom chips designed for very specific purposes As such they tend to perform better and be more efficient at these tasks compared to a GPU but arent as flexible in how they can be used Lets look at two companies that are helping lead the way with custom AI chips When it comes to custom AI chips Broadcom NASDAQ AVGO has been the leader in the space Alphabet was its first AI chip customer with Broadcom helping to design its tensorprocessing unit TPU called Trillium This chip was created to specifically work within Google Clouds TensorFlow a software library for AI and machine learning Alphabet has said these custom chips have several features that make them better than GPUs for AI training and inference These include having matrix multiply units MXUs which are components used to efficiently perform large matrix multiplications and SparseCores which are data flow processors that accelerate models relying on embeddings found in recommendation models Last quarter Alphabet credited using a combination of GPUs and TPUs as a differentiator for its cloud computing segment It said its TPUs helped lower costs while also reducing inference time Since then Broadcom has added more custom AI customers which are believed to be Meta Platforms ByteDance OpenAI and most recently Apple Braodcom saw strong growth from AI chips in its fiscal 2024 ending early November with its AI revenue topping 12 billion well above its expectations of around 75 billion going into the year The company excited investors last quarter when it indicated each of its three initial AI customers could deploy up to 1 million AI chips in 2027 which it said would represent a 60 billion to 90 billion revenue opportunity in 2027 alone It added that if its two new customers were able to get their chips into development by that time that this opportunity would be even greater While Broadcom isnt likely to win all this business with some going toward GPUs it shows the strong customer AI chip opportunity the company has in front of it The stock meanwhile trades at a forward pricetoearnings PE ratio of 355 based on 2025 analyst estimates which is attractive if it can capture a good share of the 2027 opportunity it has talked about Broadcom is not the only company that is helping customers design custom chips Marvell NASDAQ MRVL is also in the custom silicon game as well Its best known for helping Amazon with its Trainium chip that is used to help train large language models LLMs While Broadcom is believed to have completely designed chips for Alphabet based on its needs Marvel is primarily providing some intellectual property around highspeed SerDes SerializerDeserializer with Amazon doing most of the work according to analysts at Morgan Stanley On its fiscal Q3 earnings call in December Marvell said that it recently signed a fiveyear multigenerational deal with Amazons cloud unit AWS for custom AI products as well as various other data center switches and components It said the deal should lead to a significant rampup in volumes between the two companies Amazon is not Marvells only AI customer Marvell said it has a range of design wins for both AI accelerators and compute and that other programs would go into production in 2025 It also said it will have a third large customer soon At its AI day the company said it sees custom AI chips as a 40 billion market opportunity and that it thinks it can take a 20 market share or 8 billion Marvell said it was on track to exceed 15 billion in AI revenue this fiscal year with more growth expected in fiscal 2026 It said much of this will come from its custom silicon program Outside of custom AI chips Marvell is very tied to the data center market Its data center revenue soared 98 year over year last quarter to 11 billion Data center revenue now accounts for 73 of the companys total revenue up from it being 39 of its total revenue a year ago However overall revenue rose just 7 due to weakness in other end markets Overall with data center spending continuing to ramp up Marvell should see strong growth in this area The stock currently trades at 42 time next years earnings estimates which is a bit on the

financial powerhouse system with a targeted affluent clientele a broad product assortment and a complete array of banking services that make it a lot more than just a credit card company Its known for its robust rewards programs and perks which incentivize people to pay the largerthanaverage annual fees for its cards For many users the value of the perks exceeds the fees and the company enjoys loyalty from its membership base In the first nine months of 2024 its revenues increased 9 year over year and earnings per share EPS were up 28 American Express has multiple streams feeding into its earnings including the fees it takes on its cards and net interest income on its deposits That type of multifaceted business is something Buffett has mentioned that he looks for in a potential investment American Express stock increased 58 in 2024 and it also pays a dividend Now that inflation has moderated it should enjoy increased credit card business in 2025 and lower interest rates should benefit its banking division Buffett only has a small position in Visa but the company has many of the features he craves in an investment As the largest credit card network in the world it plays a major role in the global economy and thats what also gives it longterm staying power Unlike American Express Visa works with an array of financial institutions that underwrite the credit in transactions All it does is provide the infrastructure that moves money from one place to the other but its a major part of the process and individuals and merchants rely on it to keep money flowing Because its services are ubiquitous and its operation now that it has been built out over the decades is fairly capitallight Visa has unmatched profit margins that generally continue to expand and that reached 55 in fiscal 2024 Revenue increased by 10 in fiscal 2024 and EPS was up 17 But Visa isnt relying on its name or current system alone to keep going Its constantly developing new partnerships and products that complement its existing framework and ensure it can maintain its place as an indispensable cog in the machine of the global economy Visa didnt really outperform the market in 2024 gaining just 22 vs the benchmark SP 500s 25 gain but it has been a reliable marketbeater over time It also pays a growing dividend Now that inflation has moderated people could be on track to spend more in which case Visa could go back to beating the market in 2025 Amazon is also one of Buffetts smaller positions and he invested in it for the first time in 2019 Adding the stock then wasnt actually his idea credit goes to one of Berkshire Hathaways investing managers Even then when it had already minted millionaires among its shareholders he obviously felt it still had more room to grow It has gained more than 130 since that time beating the SP 500s 97 increase over that span Amazon is the top ecommerce player in the US and the top cloud computing infrastructure company in the world But its most exciting growth driver right now is generative artificial intelligence AI CEO Andy Jassy has said its the largest opportunity hes seen in technology since the cloud and maybe even since the Internet altogether He also said that 85 of global information technology spending still goes to onpremises systems but that ratio is going to flip to the cloud That transition offers a huge opportunity to Amazon and thats before adding the generative AI piece to the puzzle AI is already generating billions in revenue for Amazon and Jassy feels like that trend is just beginning

advance in the double digits The SP 500 the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 23 28 and 12 respectively And the top performers in all three indexes were companies heavily involved in AI including chip designer Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA and software company Palantir Technologies They scored the biggest wins in the Dow Average and the SP 500 respectively Why have AI stocks been so popular AI has the potential to transform many industries with certain market experts such as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon saying it could be as revolutionary as electricity or the internet So investors who get in early on AI stocks could win big over time The first success stories have been companies fueling the initial stages of AI such as the training and inferencing of AI models and these players could continue to gain But a new AI investing theme has emerged to share the spotlight and thats the area of AI agents This involves using AI to solve complex problems a move that could help companies gain efficiency Investors who get in on certain AI agent companies today may have reason to cheer as this AI boom advances Lets check out three of these stocks that could soar Nvidia again you might ask After all the stock has already climbed thanks to its strength in AI chips the key element involved in the first wave of AI growth But Nvidia also may become a key player in the world of agentic AI This is because of the companys expansion well beyond just chips and into software to support AI development Today Nvidia and its partners are offering customers blueprints to build their own AI agents At CES last week Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang spoke of five blueprints from partners integrating the Nvidia Enterprise software platform Huang talked about Nvidias own new AI blueprint to summarize video footage imagine thousands of hours of video quickly analyzed to help a business make factory operations more efficient for example So right now AI customers can not only turn to Nvidia for building blocks like graphics processing units GPUs to train their models but also go to Nvidia when theyre looking to build and use an AI agent And this equals yet another source of growth for this top AI stock moving forward Amazon NASDAQ AMZN the worlds No 1 cloud service provider is well positioned to benefit from the growth of AI agents First Amazon Web Services AWS leadership position means customers are already right there so it makes sense for them to opt for AWS AI agent services And these services are up and running Today developers can quickly and easily build AI agents to suit their needs through the Amazon Bedrock platform Thanks to sales of other AI products and services last year AWS has already reached a 110 billion annualized revenue run rate And momentum in AI agents could keep this growth going Its also important to note that Amazon itself could greatly benefit from AI agents to help the ecommerce business become more efficient and better serve customers and sellers on the platform Amazon has already gotten started here introducing Project Amelia to help sellers better analyze their data and eventually solve complex problems All this makes now a great time to get in on Amazon and potentially benefit as agentic AI takes off SoundHound AI NASDAQ SOUN is a conversational AI expert with industries from automobiles to restaurants using its technology The company stands out because it turns speech directly into meaning skipping the traditional text step and resulting in speed and higher quality for users And this company could be on the way to carving out a spot in the agentic AI space SoundHound is quickly growing its AI agent portfolio with agents that could tackle complex tasks across five industries For example the AI agent customer experience can streamline payment processes in the financial industry or handle plan upgrades in the telecom space In under a year SoundHounds AI agent helped French wholesale broker Apivia Courtage reduce the number of inbound queries handled by its human team by 20 SoundHound has also built an AI agent employee experience to assist employees and businesses in areas such as human resources and IT This voice AI specialist has seen growth explode in recent times with revenue advancing 89 in the latest quarter And though the stock has also soared it could get another big lift as

with the SP 500 confirming its presence in a bull market and soaring 23 for a second consecutive year of gains Now heading into 2025 that momentum could continue thanks to ongoing excitement about artificial intelligence AI stocks and the benefits of a lower interest rate environment But the market is also known to surprise us occasionally so its impossible to guarantee exactly what path it will take even if things look bright at the moment So whats an investor to do Consider a few tips from one of the most famous investors on the planet one who has beaten the SP 500 over time and generated billions of dollars in returns Im talking about Warren Buffett As chairman hes helped Berkshire Hathaway deliver a compounded annual gain of more than 19 over 58 years compared to the SP 500s 10 increase Buffett knows how to invest successfully over the long term making him a terrific model to follow So lets consider how to invest like the Oracle of Omaha as hes often called in 2025 In his 1986 letter to shareholders Warren Buffett said he and his team aim to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful So Buffett generally doesnt follow what everyone else in the market is doing If the trend is to buy or sell a certain company Buffett probably wont be along for the ride Instead the top investor looks at the longterm potential of each stock in his portfolio and considers other elements such as dividends paid annually For example today the average analyst estimate calls for American Express stock to change little over the coming 12 months In his most recent shareholder letter Buffett spoke favorably about American Express dividend growth along with that of another of his favorite companies CocaCola and said he intended to hold on to these stocks We will most certainly leave our holdings untouched throughout the year Could I create a better worldwide business than these two enjoy And then Buffett referring to how his sister would answer the question wrote No way This means that if youre confident about a particular stocks longterm outlook or appreciate the dividend growth think twice before selling just because others predict a nearterm decline or favor other stocks and industries Like Buffett you could win over the long term by sticking with what you believe in Though Buffett has scored many wins over time the famous investor is quick to admit hes made some mistakes too In fact one hes spoken about is his decision not to buy Amazon earlier in the companys growth story I had no idea that it had this potential he said in a 2018 CNBC interview I blew it But Berkshire Hathaway went on to buy Amazon stock in 2019 a purchase made by one of Buffetts investment managers and has held on ever since And its been a winning move as Amazon stock has advanced more than 130 over the past five years How can you apply this to your investing in 2025 Dont be afraid to buy a stock thats already gained in recent years as long as it still offers solid longterm growth prospects A good example is artificial intelligence AI chip giant Nvidia The stock has soared over the past two years but the companys earnings are solid it holds a leadership position in the AI market and its set to benefit from the new wave of AI growth So in 2025 consider every stocks longterm potential and scoop up those that offer the possibility of growth well into the future Buffett has always been a great believer in the power of American companies In his 2013 shareholder letter the billionaire wrote In aggregate American business has done wonderfully over time and will continue to do so though most assuredly in unpredictable fits and starts How can you best invest in the strength of American companies Buffett offers clear advice here recommending investment in an SP 500 index fund These funds mimic the composition of the SP 500 and therefore track its performance And Buffett puts his money where his mouth is He owns shares of both the SPDR SP 500 ETF Trust and the Vanguard SP 500 ETF Its true that through stock picking you may beat the index over time like Buffett so continue to select stocks that suit your investment strategy At the same time its a wise move to also invest in an index fund to provide you exposure to a wide range of top companies and industries This offers instant diversification and the likelihood of a win

your portfolio","Tip Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results Theres been a lot of ink spilled about the growing demand for artificial intelligence AI and the potential for the technology to revolutionize the world Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA has been one of the clearest beneficiaries of this trend The companys graphics processing units GPUs cornered the market by providing the computational horsepower needed to fuel the technology Yet Nvidias stock price has stalled over the past six months Some investors fear the gravy train has run its course and demand for its AI chips could trail off However a growing mountain of evidence provides a crystal clear answer to the question Is it too late to buy Nvidia stock The biggest contributor to Nvidias meteoric rise over the past two years has been the unrivaled performance of its GPUs These chips were originally developed to create lifelike images in video games but are equally adept at providing the computational horsepower needed to support generative AI The sheer volume of data required to train these AI models is daunting and few companies have the resources to develop these toptier models from scratch and nearly all of them are Nvidia customers The final totals for 2024 have yet to be released but Nvidia dominates the market for the data center GPUs used for AI In 2023 much like 2022 Nvidia commanded a 98 market share and its leadership position in the space isnt expected to change any time soon Even as the company has tasked its partners to ramp up production of its highend AI processors demand continues to exceed supply Theres evidence suggesting that unprecedented demand will continue Just last week Microsoft president Brad Smith announced that in fiscal 2025 which began July 1 the company is on track to invest approximately 80 billion to build out AIenabled data centers to train AI models and deploy AI and cloudbased applications He was clear about why he believed this spending was necessary Not since the invention of electricity has the United States had the opportunity it has today to harness new technology In many ways artificial intelligence is the electricity of our age and the next four years can build a foundation for Americas economic success for the next quarter century For context Microsoft spent nearly 56 billion on capital expenditures capex last fiscal year marking a 44 increase in spending This shows that investment to support AI is ramping up rather than slowing down Microsoft isnt the only tech powerhouse spending heavily on AI Alphabet is expected to spend about 51 billion on capex when its books are closed in 2024 and the company plans to ramp up spending next year On the Q3 earnings call CEO Sundar Pichai said Realizing the opportunity of AI requires meaningful capital investment and said there will be substantial increases in capital investment going into 2025 Not to be left out Amazon is expected to spend 75 billion on capex in 2024 and even more in 2025 according to CEO Andy Jassy He went on to say the majority of that will be to support its cloud unit Amazon Web Services AWS and the spending here is really driven by generative AI While it isnt a cloud provider Meta Platforms has been spending heavily to develop its cuttingedge Llama AI models The company was on track to spend roughly 39 billion in 2024 and CFO Susan Li said We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025 She previously stated that this spending was to support our AI research and product development efforts Based on these tech executives comments its clear that spending on AI is ramping up The lions share of that spending will be for the data centers and servers needed to support AI with the principal beneficiary being Nvidia whose chips underpin the technology Nvidia doesnt disclose exactly who its biggest customers are but Wall Street has done some detective work Analysts with Bloomberg and Barclays Research have concluded that Nvidias four biggest customers responsible for 40 of revenue are Microsoft 15 Meta Platforms 13 Amazon 62 Alphabet 58 Executives from each of these companies have been crystal clear about their plans to ramp capex spending the vast majority to support cloud computing and more specifically AI As the unrivaled leader in the data center GPU space Nvidia stands to reap the windfall of all this spending After generating tripledigit yearoveryear growth for five consecutive quarters Nvidias growth eventually slowed but remains impressive nonetheless During its fiscal 2025 third quarter ended Oct 27 Nvidia generated record revenue of 35 billion which surged 94 year over year and 17 sequentially At the same time adjusted earnings per share EPS of 081 soared 103 The days of tripledigit growth have likely passed but many believe Nvidia still has a long runway ahead Despite the runaway success of the companys Hopper AI processor the recently released Blackwell chip is expected to generate even more sales The processor which is in full production and began shipping late last quarter is believed to be sold out for the coming 12 months despite its recent release The mountain of evidence suggests Nvidia has a long road ahead as the adoption of AI gains steam Furthermore even after notching gains of more than 850 over the past two years as of this writing Nvidia stock remains attractively priced selling for roughly 32 times next years expected sales Given its industryleading technology the increasing demand for its processors and the reasonable valuation I

heard of a few of them and knocked milestone after milestone in the dust Heres a brief account of some major events in the life of the 236billiondollar man Jeff Bezos was born on January 12 1964 in Albuquerque New Mexico as Jeffrey Jorgensen his last name would formally be changed to Bezos after his mother married Miguel Bezos in 1968 who adopted him Hed go on to graduate with degrees in computer science and electrical engineering from Princeton University After college Bezos worked for financial tech startup Fitel and later Bankers Trust before joining hedge fund DE Shaw Co in 1990 It was at DE Shaw that he met future philanthropist and Amazon AMZN cofounder MacKenzie Scott who he married in 1993 Both Bezos and his thenwife MacKenzie Scott left DE Shaw and moved to Seattle in July 1994 as part of an endeavor that would later become Amazon The company officially launched on July 5 of that year out of the Bezos garage under the name Cadabra as in abracadabra It was later changed because it sounded too much like cadaver or a dead human body used for research The Bezos also registered the domain names Awakecom Browsecom Bookmallcom and Relentlesscom the latter still redirects users to Amazon when typed into a browser Amazoncom was registered in November 1994 after Bezos began researching a new name finding inspiration in the largest rainforest on the planet which is now severely threatened by deforestation and climate change Amazon the company launched its ubiquitous website one year later becoming an online bookstore that delivered to 45 countries Amazon was listed on the Nasdaq on May 15 1997 offering 3 million shares at an initial 18 per share Although the company has yet to produce net profit several analysts saythey expect the company to rake in revenue in the multimilliondollar range within a few years the Wall Street Journal reported at the time A year later the company would expand beyond selling just books and CDs including clothing and groceries At the time the New York Times labeled Amazon the most successful merchant on the Internet which would only prove to be increasingly accurate over the next 27 years Bezos founded Blue Origin in September 2000 inspired by the 1999 film October Sky and his earlyage ideas of humanity evacuating the Earth for life among the stars The companys goal is to facilitate human travel to space through new ultra hightech rocket ships Amazon launched its express shipping subscription Amazon Prime for a price of 79 per year during its 2004 fourthquarter earnings report Amazon Prime is allyoucaneat express shipping CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement at the time February 2005 Though expensive for the Company in the shortterm its a significant benefit and more convenient for customers The offering didnt become widely popular until years later reaching over 100 million subscribers in 2018 Prime would also inspire the companys biggest sales day of the year Prime Day which saw shoppers spend a total of 142 billion last July A followup event in October saw shoppers save more than 1 billion in deals offered for Prime members according to the company Besides Prime the 2000s was a major decade for Amazon It saw the launch of Amazon Web Services the ebook device Kindle the companys music division and a few acquisitions Bezos in August 2023 purchased the Washington Post from its parent corporation for 250 million in cash just a week after selling 614938 shares of Amazon stock for roughly 185 million That deal gave one of the USs wealthiest men control of one of its biggest newspapers At the time Bezos was focused on recreating the daily ritual of reading the Post as a bundled newspaper not just a handful of stories the Post reported He also promised handsoff management that kept the newspapers seasoned veterans in charge of editorial matters although hes since been more involved I dont feel the need to have an opinion on every issue Bezos said in a meeting with staff Im sure I dont know much about things like Syria and foreign entanglements Im happy to let the experts opine on that The billionaire recently waded into Post matters to block an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris and lay off around 100 people Amazon bought Whole Foods Market for 137 billion in June as it looked to gain a stronger foothold in the grocery market offering 42 in cash for each share The move marked its largest acquisition to date and was completed just two months later On July 27 2017 Jeff Bezos briefly became the richest person alive dethroning Microsofts MSFT Bill Gates At the time Amazons shares had surged bringing the value of his fortune to 91 billion nudging past Gates 90 billion net worth The stock would shed some of those gains later giving Gates back his spot Later that year he became the first person after Gates who did so in 1999 to achieve a 100 billion net worth In hindsight 100 billion may not seem like such a milestone at least compared to the events thatve followed As of writing Bezos is worth just shy of 234 billion according to Forbes realtime ranking of the wealthiest people alive Gates is left behind in 16th place with a 1033 billion fortune On January 9 2019 Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Scott Bezos announced they would be divorcing after 25 years of marriage As our family and close friends know after a long period of loving exploration and trial separation weve decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends they wrote in a note posted to social media The divorce was completed that April Scott agreed to give Bezos her interest in The Washington Post and Blue Origin along with 75 of their ownership of Amazon and voting control of her remaining shares That left Scott with 25 of their stock which at the time was the equivalent to 38 billion Since then shes engaged in annual rounds of giving to nonprofits donating more than 17 billion as of March In 2018 shortly before Bezos filed for divorce the billionaire began his relationship with Lauren Snchez a former media personality and founder of Black Ops Aviation an aerial film and production company Bezos and Snchez got engaged in May 2023 and currently split their time between Miami and Los Angeles According to NewsNation they expect to get married in Italy later this year An earlier report from The Daily Mail suggested they would get married late last December in a 600 million wedding in Colorado Bezos later commented that the whole thing is completely false referring to that report In July 2021 Jeff Bezos announced he would step down as CEO of Amazon at the end of the year and become its executive chair In his last letter to Amazons shareholders as CEO Bezos talked about the companys employees and customers as well as biology death democracy and tyranny We all know that distinctiveness originality is valuable We are all taught to be yourself What Im really asking you to do is to embrace and be realistic about how much energy it takes to maintain that distinctiveness Bezos wrote The world wants you to be typical in a thousand ways it pulls at you Dont let it happen Being yourself is worth it but dont expect it to be easy or free Youll have to put energy into it continuously he added In later interviews Bezos cited a desire to work on Blue Origin as a major reason for his stepping down as CEO In December 2023 he told podcaster Lex Fridman that most of my time is spent on Blue Origin and Im so deeply involved here now for the last couple of years Also that July Bezos accompanied by his brother an 18yearold from the Netherlands and an 82yearold aviation pioneer from Texas flew into space on Blue Origins New Shepard rocket to mark the 52nd anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing He was actually the second billionaire to travel to space that month with Virgin Galactics SPCE Richard Branson launching into space nine days earlier The most profound piece of it for me was looking out at the Earth and looking at the Earths atmosphere Bezos said at the time He also told reporters hed be splitting his time primarily between Blue Origin and the Bezos Earth Fund which is dedicated to sustainability and fighting climate change Blue Origin had planned to launch its longawaited New Glenn vehicle a partially reusable 322foot rocket with two stages last week before it was delayed due

internet and how a few decades since its earliest years its still growing and creating new investing opportunities The odds are high that AI will evolve and grow into the 2050s Fortunately you dont need to think that far ahead There are compelling investment opportunities right now in companies proving critical to AIs development These AI stocks have tremendous growth trajectories for the next three to five years and their current valuations should allow them to translate much of that growth into investment returns Consider buying and holding these AI winners in 2025 by 2030 youll be glad you did Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA needs little introduction Its remarkable ascension in AI due to its immensely popular Hopper AI accelerator chips has produced staggering growth and investment returns But as I said AI remains in its early chapters as does the companys growth story Nvidia is transitioning to its nextgeneration chip design Blackwell The immense computing and energy requirements for operating AI models are an underrated story in the field AI developer OpenAI recently disclosed that its still losing money on its most expensive subscription plan 2400 annually Accumulating the raw computing power to enhance AI is important but AI must also be economically feasible Therefore energy efficiency is a big deal Nvidias Blackwell chips will perform better than Hopper while operating as much as 25 times more costeffectively That has made it a nobrainer for the hyperscalers building out the vast data centers to power AI models Nvidia has reportedly sold out its Blackwell capacity for 2025 already and CEO Jensen Huang believes Blackwells launch will be Nvidias best ever That sets the table for continued growth over the coming years Analysts estimate that Nvidia will grow earnings by an average of 38 annually for the next three to five years Today Nvidia trades at a forward PE ratio of 51 a rocksolid value for its anticipated growth Amazon NASDAQ AMZN could be among the biggest AI winners Its cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services AWS is the global leader accounting for approximately 31 of the market Today enterprises increasingly rent computing power from cloud companies instead of building their own Most modern software including AI operates on the cloud That positions the company as a direct beneficiary of the impact AI could have on cloud growth According to Goldman Sachs AIs tailwinds could push the market to 2 trillion by 2030 The global cloud market was worth roughly 500 billion in 2023 so thats a tremendous opportunity Amazon as the market leader will undoubtedly benefit from that That should be music to your ears because AWS is Amazons largest profit center Amazons business goes far beyond AI and even cloud computing Its known for being the leading ecommerce company in the United States by a wide margin and has built its Prime subscription into a formidable business Analysts anticipate the companys bottom line growing by 22 annually over the next three to five years Thats enough to warrant buying the stock at its current forward PE ratio 37 despite shares trading near alltime highs Social media titan Meta Platforms NASDAQ META remains a digital advertising powerhouse It generates tens of billions of dollars in free cash flow annually from advertising to the 329 billion daily active users on Facebook Instagram WhatsApp and ThreadsCEO Mark Zuckerberg has been a longtime proponent of AI and has influenced the companys push into AI and virtual reality Meta has a dedicated business unit Reality Labs that is spending massive amounts of capital to build out the data center capacity needed for Meta to be a leading player in AI Metas capital spend topped 9 billion last quarter while Reality Labs posted a 44 billion operating loss However Zuckerberg has stated that realizing a meaningful return may take until the 2030s Its a massive gamble on the future but Zuckerbergs foresight has paid off for Meta in the past and the potential upside of being an AI leader over the coming decade and beyond is worth swinging for Generative AI alone could be worth over a trillion dollars Ultimately dont let the AI investments distract you from the fact that Meta is a fantastic business right now even without contributions from Reality Labs Analysts estimate the company will grow earnings by an average of nearly

Sign in to access your portfolio","Many analysts on Wall Street expect to see the first 4 trillion company sometime in 2025 Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA has seen its value soar amid rampant artificial intelligence AI spending as big tech companies race to build out bigger data centers and train more advanced AI models With big tech planning to spend even more in 2025 its strong results should continue Its market cap climbed from 416 billion the day OpenAI released ChatGPT to 343 trillion as of this writing The only company Nvidia trails in size is Apple NASDAQ AAPL which has long sat at or near the top of the worlds most valuable companies Apples massive iPhone user base has supported a growing services business over the past decade and AI could propel that services business in 2025 as it integrates more advanced capabilities into its iOS and macOS operating systems Its market cap sits at 367 trillion as of this writing Meanwhile Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT is leading in AI on two fronts An early investment in OpenAI gave it the integrations it needed to sell developers on its Azure cloud computing platform Azure sales have accelerated as a result and management expects that trend to continue in 2025 Meanwhile Microsofts leading position in enterprise productivity software and PC operating systems gives it a huge market for its Copilot AI agents which help improve accuracy and worker productivity It has a market cap of 316 trillion as of this writing Any of the above could become the first 4 trillion company in 2025 But one company could leapfrog them on the path to 5 trillion by the end of the decade The big reason for all of the excitement around AI is its ability to transform multiple industries And one company has its hand in several of those industries Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Thats why it could be the first company to reach a 5 trillion valuation Amazon is one of the biggest investors in AI Management said during its thirdquarter earnings call in September that it expected to spend 75 billion on capital expenditures in 2024 The majority of that spending will go toward its cloud computing business Amazon Web Services AWS and other technology infrastructure Some will go toward the continued buildout of its logistics network Amazons spending is absolutely massive but its proven to be well worth the price Even while investing more than any other big tech company its generating record amounts of free cash flow Free cash flow climbed to 477 billion over the trailing 12 months in Q3 more than doubling year over year Those strong financial results are driven by Amazons diverse operations AWS has been a strong driving force AWS sales accelerated in 2024 increasing 19 year over year in Q3 Moreover AWS now has substantial scale which shows up in operating income growth of 49 in Q3 AWS growth is powered by Amazons support for advanced AI development across multiple foundation models It continues to work on more efficient custombuilt AI accelerators for training and inference which give its customers lowercost options compared to Nvidias chips Meanwhile the core of Amazon has always been its ecommerce business Amazon continues to grow its share of ecommerce year after year despite strong competition from bigbox retailers improving their online operations and ultracheap alternatives like Temu and Shein The main reason Amazon has proved so successful at defending and expanding its lead is its Prime membership Prime subscriptions give customers free oneday shipping on millions of items on Amazons marketplace along with various other benefits including Prime Video The growth of Prime is a virtuous cycle whereby more members attract more merchants offering a wider variety of goods in turn attracting more Prime members Amazons subscription services revenue continues to climb at a doubledigit pace despite its high penetration rate among consumers Amazon isnt just standing by and letting the flywheel spin Its actively pushing It overhauled its logistics operations in 2023 to focus on multiple regions throughout the United States It uses advanced algorithms that predict demand and monitor instock levels to ensure items remain in stock across each region The new regionalized network forms the foundation of a burgeoning logistics services business as well Finally Amazons strong position in ecommerce has helped it build a massive digital advertising business Ad sales totaled 536 billion over the trailing 12 months Amazon should be able to sustain that pace as it expands video advertising all Prime memberships include adsupported streaming by default Generative AI has the potential to supercharge ad sales on Amazon especially considering Amazons scale and data which can fuel iterative testing for ad campaigns ensuring better conversions for merchants Amazons business is operated with one key metric in mind longterm freecashflow generation To that end its been a wild success As mentioned free cash flow totaled 477 billion over the last 12 months Thats up from about 1 billion 10 years ago Over the next five years free cash flow could climb even higher AWS fueled by the growth of AI is showing strong improvements in operating income Despite the massive spending to build out new data centers develop its own chips and attract new customers with improvements to the platform growth is outpacing the increased spending Moreover Amazon is currently undergoing a massive investment cycle The 75 billion in expected 2024 capital expenditures is a new record for the company Its likely to increase further in 2025 But eventually that spending will plateau At that point Amazon will reap what its sown across AWS its logistics network and its ecommerce business which fuels its advertising business That cycle has played out multiple times for Amazon over the last 30 years Historically Amazon has traded around 50 times free cash flow At that multiple it would be worth 5 trillion once it produces 100 billion in free cash flow That may happen sooner than investors expect given the strong growth in free cash flow looks poised to continue soaring through the end of the decade Before you

artificial intelligence AI These players like Nvidia Broadcom or Super Micro Computer produce chips or equipment such as servers for data centers the place where AI development begins After all its necessary to train large language models before they can actually do the job of solving problems and executing tasks And these companies should continue to see growth ahead as there is plenty more AI training and data center buildout to be done At the same time another area of AI may share the spotlight this year and this has to do with the idea of putting AI to work Im talking about the development and use of AI agents These are AIs that help companies or industries with complex tasks that involve reasoning and taking action on that reasoning Several companies are progressing in the area of AI agents right now but my prediction is one in particular will be one of the biggest winners of the AI agent boom Lets check out this stock to buy now First though lets take a closer look at the potential of AI agents These are software programs that can interact with a human consider a problem use data to develop a solution and act on it They can be used in just about any field for instance insurers could use them for initial queries and the processing of certain claims or the travel industry might use them for reservations and customer support And each operation makes the agent smarter because data from it is fed back into the system The idea is these agents can accomplish certain tasks then escalate to a human for highly complex operations This frees up the humans in various departments allowing them to work on other projects a huge boost to efficiency and a great way for companies to save money The AI agent market at a compound annual growth rate of more than 44 is expected to reach 47 billion by 2030 according to Markets and Markets data So which company is heading for an AI agent victory in this highgrowth market My prediction is Amazon NASDAQ AMZN will be one of the biggest winners and this is because the company will benefit from the technology in two different ways as a user of agentic AI and a seller of tools to develop AI agents Lets consider the AI agent use opportunity first Amazon is a leader in ecommerce with a massive fulfillment network worldwide and here AI agents could play a key role in boosting efficiency and customer and seller satisfaction and this should support earnings growth over time Amazon already has taken the first steps in this direction launching Project Amelia a chatbot to help sellers improve their businesses Initially sellers can ask questions like how should I prepare my store for the holiday season or might ask for updates on their stores traffic and sales data Progressively Project Amelia will offer answers to complex questions solve problems and take action making itself a true AI agent The companys Amazon Web Services AWS is the worlds top cloud computing player and this is where Amazon can benefit from selling tools AWS makes it simple for developers to build their own AI agents suiting their business needs thanks to its Amazon Bedrock platform the creation of an agent requires only a few steps So here Amazon makes it easy for others to get in on this opportunity to become more efficient And since AWS already is the market leader potential customers are right there ready to use the platform to start their AI agent journey Amazon isnt new to the general AI market the company already uses many AI tools across its ecommerce business and sells everything from chips to AI services through AWS And the work is bearing fruit Last year AWS reached a 110 billion annual revenue run rate thanks to sales of AI products and services Now as AI agents gain momentum I would expect AWS and Amazon as a whole to benefit And thats why I predict this player will be one of the biggest success stories of this new wave of AI growth Before you buy stock in Amazon consider this The Motley Fool

computing and more recently artificial intelligence AI Nonetheless with a market cap now of over 23 trillion it is likely approaching a point at which highpercentage growth will become more difficult Thus investors may want to consider other consumeroriented stocks that can more easily turn market potential into more rapid growth The following two stocks hold the potential to generate higher returns than the ecommerce and cloud giant Admittedly an energy drink that is No 3 in the market is not an obvious place to look for an outperforming stock However investors need to take a closer look at Celsius NASDAQ CELH It stands out by marketing itself as using natural ingredients That approach helped it win a following with health enthusiasts Sales levels also became supercharged after it signed a distribution deal with PepsiCo That increased its availability allowing outlets such as Amazon and Costco to sell its energy drinks in large quantities Unfortunately distribution issues caused its stock to fall more than 70 from its high last year as a major distributor likely PepsiCo drastically reduced its orders Nonetheless the distributor will probably rightsize its orders in the future likely making this issue less of a factor Moreover sales of 1 billion in the first three quarters of 2024 managed to grow 5 While that is dramatically slower than the 104 yearly growth in the first nine months of 2023 it still constitutes an increase Additionally international purchases only made up 5 of Celsius revenue in the first nine months of 2024 Still sales grew by a combined 38 annually in the Europe and AsiaPacific regions in the first nine months of the year Given the growth potential of these markets overall sales growth should improve as the companys nonNorth American markets claim a higher percentage of the sales Furthermore the stock price decline has taken its PE ratio to 41 a level just off multiyear lows Assuming overall sales increases can at least match its international growth rate over time Celsius stock will probably move on from the recent distribution disruptions and resume its march higher Alternatively if investors prefer to outperform Amazon within its own industries they may want to turn to the company widely perceived as the Amazon of China Alibaba NYSE BABA Admittedly fear of another trade war with the US has depressed the stocks of Chinabased companies despite Alibabas lack of exposure to the US Also a slowing economy in China coupled with almost 38 billion in fines between 2021 and 2023 for regulatory violations weighed significantly on its stock However given Alibabas performance one has to wonder whether the selloff is overdone The stock is down by almost 75 from its alltime high in 2020 and is even down 10 from its IPO in 2014 That decline has left it with a PE ratio of just 17 far less than Amazon which trades at 48 times earnings amid significant multiple compression Also with Alibabas forward PE ratio of just 10 investors may not fully appreciate the growth it is likely to experience Indeed one could argue Alibaba has become cheap for a reason Its revenue in the first six months of fiscal 2024 was 68 billion a gain of 5 from yearago levels This is a dramatic pullback from the same period in 2021 when yearly revenue growth was 31 Still the nearly 10 billion in net income for the first six months of 2024 surged 13 higher from yearago levels Hence even with more muted growth levels Alibabas profits appear to be rising too fast to justify its rockbottom forward PE ratio That factor alone could spark rapid stock price growth if negative sentiment surrounding Alibaba fades over the course of the year Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks Then youll want to

the year with all systems go to leverage its ecommerce platform to gain market share and harness the power of artificial intelligence AI to supercharge its cloud platform 2025 is starting off strong but you should buy stocks that have longterm potential Lets see where Amazon might be five years from now Amazon has been steadily gaining market share in ecommerce over the past few years and eMarketer expects it to have surpassed 40 of total US ecommerce sales in 2024 It got a lot of competition from smaller companies that went online early in the pandemic but it has improved its logistics networks and done a lot of other things to reinforce its top position and expand its lead It recently switched from a national to a regional warehouse system and thats important as physical store chains use their physical footprint as a distribution channel Both Walmart and Costco Wholesale are leveraging their many stores all over the country to ship orders quickly and cheaply and they also have the advantage of being able to offer omnichannel options like store pickup that Amazon cant Instead Amazon is doing what it does best offering the quickest and cheapest delivery options for online orders The company is also adding tons of products to ensure that its Prime customers continue to rely on it for everything they need It keeps improving speed which increases the chance that customers will keep using it for their everyday essentials and more and its also making efforts to cut costs Sameday orders increased 25 year over year in the third quarter and sameday deliveries are also one of its cheapest systems to operate It recently piloted a new warehouse model in Louisiana that incorporates new robotics technology Its already cutting processing time by 25 which should drive a 25 improvement in costs In five years Amazon should have even more of the ecommerce market which itself is growing generating organic growth opportunities As it gets bigger growth might slow down Amazon Web Services AWS Amazons cloud computing division accounts for 31 of the total global cloud market according to Statista Secondplace Microsoft Azure has 20 and while its lead isnt as dramatic as in ecommerce its still hefty Clients who were budgeting when inflation skyrocketed are spending again and more importantly clients who want to get in on generative AI are flocking to AWS platform Thats because Amazon has developed an incredibly powerful AI business that offers all kinds of products and features to meet almost any demand Management describes it as a threetier system with tools for developers to create their own large language models LLM its own Bedrock system for midsize enterprises to use Amazons LLMs and plugin solutions for small business clients AWS sales growth accelerated in the third quarter to 19 year over year and generative AI is already a billiondollar business However CEO Andy Jassy thinks its in its infancy and has massive longterm potential On Decembers thirdquarter earnings call he said It is a really unusually large maybe onceinalifetime type of opportunity In five years AWS should still be growing at a fast pace It also accounts for most of Amazons operating income 62 in the third quarter and it should help Amazon expand its margins Streaming isnt the first thing people usually think of when they think of Amazon because Amazon is so much more But its still competitive in streaming and it owns MGM Studios providing it with firstrate content that rivals the other big players It has the rights to Thursday Night Football and the CowboysGiants game in the third quarter was the moststreamed regular season football game ever It also has highly rated series like The Lord of the Rings The Rings of Power It recently rolled out an adsupported tier like Netflix and Walt Disney combined with a robust advertising business to generate new opportunities in the ad business In five years Amazon should be able to stay competitive adding new content beefing up the ad part and potentially making another acquisition The ad business has been Amazons fastestgrowing operation for a while Having access to Amazons hundreds of millions of Prime members who are all online to shop is a huge benefit for advertisers Amazons datarich AIbased system also gives advertisers the tools to succeed Amazon is constantly acquiring new companies while launching new products and businesses to create more sales opportunities Its investing in healthcare and its pharmacy business and its made several acquisitions over the past few years It recently acquired AI company Anthropic and I expect that its coming rollouts and acquisitions will also be focused on growing the AI business Amazon stock beat the market in 2024 and its well positioned to do it again this year Even though its already made millionaires this company still has incredible growth prospects It may not be the same as a young upstart but it also comes with less

Magnificent Seven Amazon had a great 2024 as investors piled into largecap technology stocks participating in the artificial intelligence AI revolution But Amazon had also entered the year with some big questions hanging over it as investors wondered whether it had fallen behind rivals in the AI race Yet over the course of the year Amazon put many of those concerns to rest Coming into 2024 some thought Amazon was caught late to the AI game After all cloud rival Microsoft invested early in OpenAI the company behind ChatGPT which appeared to give Microsoft the early lead in AI cloud workloads But did anyone think Amazon of all companies would take this lying down Since 2023 Amazon has gotten to work on its own AI cloud services First leveraging its size as the largest cloud provider heading into the AI revolution Amazon rolled out its Bedrock cloud services in mid2023 Amazon Bedrock offers a variety of competing thirdparty large language models for developers giving perhaps the most diversified AI tool portfolio of any cloud provider Additionally in late 2023 Amazon invested in OpenAI rival Anthropic which is run by OpenAIs exvice president of research Dario Amodei and is available on Bedrock Amazon then followed up that initial investment with two more investments in Anthropic in 2024 Amazons latest investment in November amounted to 4 billion bringing its total investment in Anthropic to 8 billion In conjunction with that investment Anthropic agreed to use AWS as its primary cloud provider and training partner while also committing to use Amazons Trainium and Inferentia chips to train and run its future AI models The collaboration appeared to both validate Anthropic as a key player in the AI races and a serious OpenAI competitor while also validating Amazons inhouse chips as worthy tools against the current AI training standard of expensive Nvidia GPUs But it wasnt just press releases and investments that drove Amazon higher positive financial results did too AWS revenue growth accelerated 19 in the third quarter up from 12 a year earlier And perhaps just as important the segments operating margin expanded from 303 to 381 over that same period Not to be outdone or forgotten Amazons ecommerce segment also picked up the pace and expanded margins too Amazons North America and International ecommerce empires continued their solid growth in the highsingledigits and lowdoubledigits respectively Meanwhile North America ecommerce operating margins expanded by a full percentage point from 49 to 59 while the International business expanded margins from 03 to a positive 36 margin over the past year Amazon spent the past couple of years cutting costs and transitioning to a regional delivery system in its ecommerce business and this years rapid margin expansion appears to show those efforts paying off Amazon has demonstrated resilience in the face of several bear markets and recessions over its corporate life After a difficult postpandemic slowdown the past years improvements show Amazons management culture to be as smart and resilient as its ever been even following the 2021 retirement of founder Jeff Bezos While the stock cant be considered cheap at 35 times this years earnings expectations Amazon has always appeared expensive to many as it has long prioritized longterm thinking over shortterm profits That being said the companys ability to expand profit margins this year after the rapid rise in interest rates since 2022 speaks volumes about Amazons dynamism With this commitment to both innovation and longterm

term Ideally a business will show two trends firstly a growing return on capital employed ROCE and secondly an increasing amount of capital employed This shows us that its a compounding machine able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns So when we looked at Amazoncom NASDAQAMZN and its trend of ROCE we really liked what we saw If you havent worked with ROCE before it measures the return pretax profit a company generates from capital employed in its business The formula for this calculation on Amazoncom is Return on Capital Employed Earnings Before Interest and Tax EBIT Total Assets Current Liabilities 014 US61b US585b US161b Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024 So Amazoncom has an ROCE of 14 In absolute terms thats a pretty normal return and its somewhat close to the Multiline Retail industry average of 12 View our latest analysis for Amazoncom Above you can see how the current ROCE for Amazoncom compares to its prior returns on capital but theres only so much you can tell from the past If youre interested you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Amazoncom The trends weve noticed at Amazoncom are quite reassuring The numbers show that in the last five years the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 14 Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that 233 more capital is being employed now too The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multibaggers and thats why were impressed In summary its great to see that Amazoncom can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multibaggers And a remarkable 135 total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future With that being said we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence Before jumping to any conclusions though we need to know what value were getting for the current share price Thats where you

Berkshire Hathaway He has the ability to spot value that others miss but most importantly he has the temperament and patience to go against the crowd Market volatility doesnt faze him because he focuses on the longterm value of the business Berkshires stock portfolio is full of strong businesses that can grow your savings over time Heres why three Motley Fool contributors believe Amazon NASDAQ AMZN TMobile US NASDAQ TMUS and Ulta Beauty NASDAQ ULTA are great buys to start 2025 John Ballard Amazon Berkshire Hathaway has held a position in Amazon since 2019 and it still held 10 million shares at the end of the third quarter of 2024 Amazons strength in several areas of its business makes it one of the best growth stocks to consider holding in 2025 and beyond Amazons online and physical stores generate less than half of the companys 620 billion in trailing12month revenue Its online store is growing sales at singledigit rates right now but managements efforts to lower costs including the use of more automation in fulfillment centers and shortening delivery distances to customers doorsteps are boosting profits In the last quarter Amazons operating profit grew 55 year over year to 174 billion Most of Amazons operating profit still comes from its fastgrowing cloud services division Amazon Web Services AWS Revenue from AWS accelerated in 2024 as demand for AI services continued to ramp up Theres a tremendous longterm opportunity in the 300 billion cloud market and Amazon is the leader Other nonretail services also continue to grow at healthy rates and fuel Amazons profit growth including advertising and thirdparty seller services However a key sign of Amazons growing appeal to consumers is the 11 yearoveryear growth in sales from subscription services last quarter which includes Prime and other entertainment offerings Amazon is clearly continuing to attract more customers to its ecosystem of services which bodes well for its position in a competitive marketplace The stock has had a nice run over the last few years but its progress in improving margins and continuing to attract corporate customers to AWS should deliver attractive returns for Amazon investors in 2025 and beyond Jeremy Bowman TMobile 2025 could be a tumultuous year on the stock market Presidentelect Donald Trump seems likely to shake up markets with tariffs and other policy changes and artificial intelligence has led to inflated valuations across the SP 500 Against that backdrop a classic Buffett strategy would be to invest in a stable cashflowing dividendpaying stock and one of the best out there right now is TMobile TMobile competes in whats essentially a triopoly with ATT and Verizon Communications in telecom The industry has high barriers to entry stable cash flows and it provides a service that wont easily be disrupted all things that Buffett looks for in a stock To boot TMobile has outperformed ATT and Verizon by avoiding the mistakes its two rivals have made and made smarter strategic decisions with spectrum As a result the stock has soared in recent years while its two biggest competitors have flatlined In its third quarter the company continued its industryleading performance with service revenue up 5 to 167 billion and postpaid service or monthly contract revenue up 8 to 133 billion It also topped the industry with postpaid net account additions of 315000 and postpaid net customer additions of 16 million TMobile continues to expand margins a benefit of growing in an industry with high fixed costs as net income jumped 43 in the quarter to 31 billion That trend should continue into 2025 as the company has more financial flexibility with less debt than ATT and Verizon making it better positioned for acquisitions and it leads the industry in 5G coverage making its network the most attractive With a dividend yield of 17 and a track record of share buybacks TMobile looks like an excellent Buffett stock to own for 2025 Jennifer Saibil Ulta Beauty Ulta is one of Buffetts newer buys and hes already sold off most of it Berkshire Hathaway first took a position in Ulta in the 2024 second quarter and it sold 96 of that position in the third quarter Ulta stock now accounts for just over 10 billion and represents a minuscule percentage of the total equity portfolio Does this mean Buffett has no confidence in Ulta He hasnt said anything about it so investors dont really know The sale implies that at present the larger stake in Ulta doesnt fit Berkshire Hathaways needs or goals But since it still held onto a piece of it I think investors can infer that he does have confidence in the company Ulta stock performed poorly in 2024 losing 11 of its value while the SP 500 gained 25 Its operating in a challenging environment and whats usually a plus for it became a minus What Im referring to is its model of offering everything a beauty enthusiast could want from mass products to luxury goods It merged the two when it developed its beauty megastores whereas previously customers could only get mass beauty products at pharmacies or similar stores and luxury merchandise at department stores In good times it attracts all kinds of customers who do all their beauty shopping under Ultas many roofs But in pressured times like the past year customers switch down from luxury brands to cheaper ones if theyre spending on extras at all Its been a rough year for Ulta In the fiscal 2024 third quarter ended Nov 2 sales crept up 17 and comparable sales increased just 06 Investors have been more concerned about the operating margin which contracted from 131 last year to 126 this year in the quarter Why can it do better in 2025 First of all it just got a new CEO Former chief operating officer Kecia Steelman is stepping into the lead role and shes a company veteran who can bring an informed view to the table As inflation moderates customers may be ready to start spending more and theyre likely to do it at their favorite beauty store And the operating margin is the lowest its been since the height of the COVID19 pandemic Any improvement or betterthanexpected performance should give the stock a boost 2025 could be a big turnaround year at Ulta but more importantly the longterm outlook is strong Its still generating higher sales and maintaining profitability opening new stores and attracting loyal

year is a great time to review what happened over the last 12 months and take some lessons from it So as 2025 gets underway lets take a quick look back to see the highlights and lowlights from 2024 and what could be in store for the year ahead Without a doubt one of the biggest investing themes of 2024 was artificial intelligence AI stocks Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA the king of AI stocks battled Apple in a struggle to claim the title of the worlds largest public company by market cap As of this writing Nvidia has once again surpassed the iPhone maker to claim the top spot albeit by the narrowest of margins However 2024 saw many other AI stocks surge too Palantir Technologies stock soared by a remarkable 341 SoundHound AIs stock advanced an eyepopping 836 It wasnt just the pureplay AI stocks that benefited last year Overall it was a big year for big tech Meta Platforms Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Alphabet and Apple all outperformed the SP 500 in 2024 Only Microsoft lagged the benchmark index In short thanks to the continued unfolding of the AI boom technology was a great place to invest in 2024 If there was one sector that just didnt work for investors in 2024 it was budget retailersconvenience pharmacies Walgreens Boots Alliance Dollar Tree Dollar General and CVS Health were among the worstperforming stocks in 2024 Each of them declined by at least 40 for the year with Walgreens losing more than 60 of its value The effects of inflation took a toll on all of these companies as consumers cut back on purchases As for the pharmacy retailers falling reimbursement rates for drugs increased theft and rising competition sent shares tumbling Running a close second to the budget retailers were certain healthcare stocks In particular Moderna and Biogen Moderna suffered a prolonged hangover as demand for COVID19 vaccines fell Shares of the vaccine maker tumbled by more than 57 Biogen on the other hand has various problems that contributed to its 41 selloff Sales of its key Alzheimers drug have slowed and there are concerns that the companys drug pipeline is weak meaning future revenue could come under pressure To sum up discount retailers convenience pharmacies and certain drugmakers were the big losers in 2024 As has been the case for many years I currently prefer growth stocks to value stocks In particular the tech sector remains a favorite of mine However surveying the tech landscape at the start of 2025 three stocks stand out as companies that I want to buy and hold forever Nvidia Amazon Tesla NASDAQ TSLA Nvidia makes the cut because it remains the primary beneficiary of the AI boom While Nvidias competitive advantage will eventually fade there are no signs of it happening anytime soon The company still designs the best AI chips and demand for its products remains redhot In turn the company is growing revenue and profits at a breakneck pace In short it remains all systems go for Nvidia as 2025 gets under way As for Amazon Im a longtime believer and shareholder in the company As Ive noted before Amazon is best viewed as a conglomerate rather than simply an ecommerce company Amazon Web Services AWS now generates over 100 billion in revenue per year making it a giant in its own right if it were ever spun off into its own company As for ecommerce Amazon is growing its profitability through innovations like robotics which drive down costs and shorten delivery times to consumers Finally theres Tesla Similar to Amazon I believe investors need to adjust how they think of Tesla True automotive sales still make up a huge share of the companys revenue but increasingly Tesla is becoming a robotics company As its autonomous driving software FSD improves Teslas true value could be unlocked as the company expands into ridesharing autonomous deliveries and futuristic applications we havent even considered Thats to say nothing of the companys Optimus robot which could provide another revenue stream To sum up Teslas future still looks bright as we step into 2025 making it one of my top choices as a stock to buy and hold forever Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks Then youll want to hear this On

able to produce tremendous returns for shareholders Two examples are Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and Apple NASDAQ AAPL successful enterprises that touch the lives of billions of people daily Despite their massive sizes they both deserve to be on your investment radar Which of these Magnificent Seven stocks is the best one to buy right now In the last 12 months Amazon reported net sales of 620 billion This is a gargantuan sum that would make you believe the top line has no upside going forward But thats a flawed assumption as Amazon benefits from numerous secular tailwinds For starters the company is the clear leader in the ecommerce market According to Statista nearly 40 of all online shopping in the US goes through Amazoncom well ahead of secondplace Walmart Ecommerce spending accounts for just 16 of total retail activity in the US so there is a long growth runway that Amazon can capture And besides streaming entertainment and digital advertising Amazon Web Services AWS is making the company a cloud computing leader commanding 31 global market share in the industry Revenue growth has accelerated in recent quarters boosted by heightened customer interest in artificial intelligence AI Recently Amazons management team led by CEO Andy Jassy has been focused on cost cuts and operational efficiency A business as large as this one unsurprisingly developed some bloat that needed addressing This is music to investors ears Thats because Amazons bottom line is expanding at a rapid clip Operating income soared 55 year over year to 174 billion in Q3 And executives believe that figure will increase 36 at the midpoint in the justended fourth quarter Wall Street analysts expect revenue to rise 11 in 2025 but they forecast operating income to just 21 I believe a continuation of this trend is in store for the foreseeable future Apple is the worlds most valuable company with a market cap of just under 37 trillion Getting to this point can be attributed to its strong brand presence one that consumers associate with a premium status highquality offerings and exceptional design and innovation This has helped the business benefit from pricing power over the years Apples hardware devices most notably the iPhone get a lot of attention Thats warranted as this single product represented 51 of company revenue in fiscal 2024 ended Sept 28 And its precisely what has made Apple a global icon But revenue growth here isnt exciting anymore Thats not the case for the companys various software and services offerings like Apple TV iCloud Apple Pay and advertising which are becoming more important for the overall business This division has grown revenue at a compound annual rate of 12 in the past three years faster than hardware And it boasts a fantastic gross margin of 74 The combination of hardware and software creates Apples powerful ecosystem This locks users in and discourages them from leaving to competitors In other words there are switching costs Another compelling trait Apple possesses is its pristine financial condition The company is incredibly profitable raking in 937 billion in net income in fiscal 2024 good for a net profit margin of 24 That has helped support a balance sheet position with 50 billion in net cash reducing financial risk for investors Theres no question these two companies are topnotch enterprises But investors cant ignore valuation as the price you pay matters As of this writing Amazon trades at a forward pricetoearnings ratio of 36 while Apples multiple is at 33 Amazons quickly expanding bottom line especially when compared to Apples more muted growth helps justify paying what is a slightly premium valuation Looking out over the next five years I believe Amazon has a chance to produce a higher return than Apple

today because its not a caffeine day but Im still ready to go Dylan Lewis Youre still bringing the energy with the caffeinefree Monday Its always a coffee morning for me Tim It might be a hot cocoa afternoon with the snow that weve gotten here in Washington DC Im very excited I am in the winter spirit but we have plenty to talk about before I can go frolic out there in the white stuff We got our first preview of some of the things that will be coming for the consumer electronics show and whats going on in the state of tech streaming this week Ahead of the trade show Comcast announced its new adbuying platform Universal Ads The company will be using its own properties in a hope to simplify the ad buying process in particular for small and medium sized businesses Tim I feel like theres already a company that does a little bit of ad buying over streaming video Tim Beyers There is You might have heard of it Its called The Trade Desk Boy I dont mean to sound cynical Dylan But does this not sound like a money grab Dylan Lewis It does Tim Beyers This totally sounds like a money grab Its not necessarily a bad thing although we dont really know too much about the details of this But heres why I say its a money grab We have a lot of different companies that are competing to be the provider of record of advertisements once theyve got your data The argument is Hey look youre here weve got your data we know best how to serve you so well be the ones that serve ads to you This has gone back a long time But probably the biggest benefactors of this shift in recent years have been Amazon built a huge advertising business because hey we know youre buying habits You should come advertise inside the Amazon platform and that has become a big business Walmart is another one that has profited from this At the same time I find it a curiosity Dylan that this has come really just like two months after The Trade Desk decided to say Hey were going to create a connected TV operating system for devices because everybody else has this selfinterested The Amazon Fire they have their own content Theyre not Switzerland here Well be Switzerland Well give you an open platform here Everybody wants a piece of this pie Dylan Is Universal Ads going to be materially better Is it going to be more simplified which is the pitch here I dont know if thats true Well I have a strong suspicion I should say that Comcast seized the margin opportunity and has decided to seize it Dylan Lewis It does feel a little bit like theyre doing the Apple thing of Hey we didnt need to be first to this but we saw how you were doing it and we like how it looks and we think we can get some margins doing it so were going to do it too I suppose if youre someone who wants to advertise and you want to advertise on their programs it doesnt really matter whether you want a Switzerlandtype relationship you are going to have to play on Universal Ads if thats the only game in town for getting onto their channel Tim Beyers Well its not clear to me that they have said its the only way to do it but it certainly feels like this is going to be the primary way and there may be some strong incentives to go through Universal Ads But its a dangerous game to make it the only avenue especially when the government has its eye on portals which has been a thing The government has been very conscious of portals and without making any political statements here one of the commonalities between the outgoing administration and the incoming administration is that both have been lets say looking somewhat askance at Big Tech They have not necessarily been buddy buddy We shouldnt presume that the next administration is going to be any more interested in giving free license to tech companies big mergers I think anytime a company decides to exert portal control you may be inviting scrutiny you dont want Dylan Lewis I think one of the interesting things is Comcast is very much seeing whats happening in Big Tech and saying wed like a piece of that and wed like to be able to have our own version of that They in the grand scheme of advertising look at a Facebook or a YouTube and say they have 10 million advertisers and we have several thousand advertisers when it comes to people who are across NBC Universal They clearly feel like they are a small player in this space even though they are maybe able to possess the relationship in a way that those other players maybe couldnt for their own content Tim Beyers To be fair we are also talking about lots of different ways One of the things thats probably going to be true about 2025 that makes this an interesting time to be trying something like Universal Ads is that we are seeing new bundles new ways of getting things I personally right now dont have access to generalized cable but I have access to Peacock and I have access to Paramount and honestly I have access to YouTube and YouTube gives me most of what I want because most things are available later on YouTube You know what Im fine with that Dylan Lewis Youre fine with waiting Tim You dont mind waiting around Tim Beyers I dont mind waiting around Dylan Lewis You mentioned Peacock and I want to get an alarm meter from you on this for The Trade Desk and for trade desk shareholders Im asking selfishly because I am one here Trade Desk was going to be one of the people selling NBC Universals Peacock I think that was announced back in 2021 They have been one of several companies that have been selling inventory there I think for the last couple of years We dont know a lot of the details of this yet but when you see this news how big of a deal do you think this is for The Trade Desk Tim Beyers I dont know how big of a deal it is for The Trade Desk but I do think the ground is shifting a little bit in terms of whos going to own the brokering relationship for putting ads out into the market That seems to be undetermined at this point Now to be fair I do think there is a big market for an independent broker that can provide good data fair pricing transparent pricing I think the market needs that I dont see them being disrupted by this but I think the desire for companies and now Comcast is another one of them do take greater control of the customer relationship and leverage that customer relationship Thats going to be something that The Trade Desk is going to have to work through dont underestimate how much of this has to do with Netflix envy I wouldnt be surprised if this is Netflix envy Dylan not at all Dylan Lewis Theyre saying you innovated in this space you created the category youve got a successful business there rolling out the ads We want a part of that We want the membership model we want the ad revenue we want it all Tim Beyers Absolutely we want a piece Dont ever underestimate envy as a motivating factor for sure Dylan Lewis Sticking with streaming Comcast is not the only one making moves this week Disney also apparently nearing a deal to bring Hulu Live TV together with Fubo This is a smaller streamer that is known for its sports content The focus on sports here maybe not necessarily a surprise because Disney has been developing venue sports with Fox and Warner Brothers and Fubo has been a thorn in their side as theyve been trying to do that too Tim Beyers In fact they sued over it A judge had actually blocked the launch of a venue Fubo did was starting to get some traction here from that lawsuit This is according to the Wall Street Journal that the judge said that the deal this new bundle would substantially lessen competition and restrain trade Not great The partners in Venue which are essentially the partners in Hulu and the Hulu Live TV service have appealed the decision but now it does look like by virtue of an acquisition or a merger I guess it would be in this case you can make that litigation go away It is interesting This is what I said previously We are talking about different types of very specialized bundles showing up Streaming it makes your ability to make a bundle that fits you a little more compelling Like I said in this case my bundle is YouTube free I pay for it with ads and then cheap Peacock and Paramount I get a fair amount of sports ball which I want and I get some decent TV programming and I get plenty of movies Im good The only other one Ive added to that is Netflix I added that recently Thats a very tailored bundle You can see Dylan that this is going to be a thing where you have specialized bundles coming together to serve a particular niche In this case its sports But it might be something entirely different It may be a reality TV bundle or cooking shows bundle I fully expect that that comes around At some point this is just the precursor To be clear about whats happening here this feels more than anything else like look we just want to move forward with our sports bundle Can we get the litigation to stop I think thats what this is Dylan Lewis Fubo TV I think before this deal was announced was a subbillion dollar company I could see Disney basically saying I think we can pay to make this go away for about 15 billion I think thats within our wheelhouse The venue sports bundle that they are developing with Fox and Warner Brothers focused on sports No surprise there its right there in the name Live games and event coverage from the major professional sports leagues and major college conferences sounds very appealing I think whats fascinating about this is Disney just spent so much time trying to untangle the multiowned joint venture that is Hulu Then theyre are saying lets hop right back into that lane with venue sports Tim What do you make of that Tim Beyers Irony never disappoints Number 1 never ever does it disappoint Thats Number 1 But Number 2 is it tells you something about the appeal of targeted bundling Thats what I mean When I said that I think we can expect to see more targeted bundling I think Disney has woken up to realize that it might be a bit of an ask for some people to say you can get the whole big enchilada If you want live TV in that Hulu bundle its still not that cheap Youre still not that far off 100 if you want live TV in a bundle I dont know that that is a sale that works anymore In the era of YouTube and very targeted streaming Im not sure Im the only one whos like I dont know that I need that It just went YouTube my very targeted streaming services Figuring out how to maybe make these things a little bit more appetizing I think is the thing One of the ways to do it is to control a niche and then package the niche Well see but its a very interesting time Dylan Lewis Putting the story here with Fubo and Disney together with that Universal Ads story I do see a little bit of a throughline in that it seems like it is going to get impossible almost for smaller players to really establish themselves in streaming The Trade Desks of the world they were able to seize a market opportunity because the legacy players hadnt quite gotten there yet Fubo was one of those smaller players that people have thought maybe might be able to turn into something I dont know how easy its going to be for anyone over the next five or ten years that is not already a major media brand to hop into this space whether its on the ad side or on the content side Tim Beyers Thats a really good point and its hard to see to maybe validate your point a bit here the great cautionary tale in this space is CuriosityStream which is now the MicroWest of microcaps Dylan Lewis Its 100 million I think Tim Beyers It just hasnt really gone anywhere For those who dont know the ticker CURI is a microcap streamer of documentaries Its not like thats a bad service or something that is unwanted There are people who are very much in the market for yes I want to see a bunch of documentaries but how you make that into something big is its just harder to see To your point youre probably going to have the major media companies But what those major media companies are doing is a different strategy to profit which may be like creating some balkanized very specialized content bundles and maybe not trying to make you swallow 100 to 200 a month but trying to get you on a consistent 35 a month Does that actually work I dont know but that favors the companies that already have a chokehold on content and licensing deals Dylan Lewis Tim you know what one of my favorite bundles is Tim Beyers Tell me Dylan Lewis You and Monday Motley Fool Money Thanks for joining me today Tim Beyers Nice Well done Thank you Thanks Dylan MUSIC Dylan Lewis Listeners coming up on the show Youve probably heard about the sports betting platform DraftKings But what about the company that powers DraftKings and a number of other sports betting platforms around the world Up next Anand Chokkavelu host Dan Caplinger and Dave Meier for a Scoreboard episode Breaking Down Sportradar MUSIC Anand Chokkavelu Welcome to latest Motley Fool Scoreboard Im Anand Chokkavelu Weve got longtime Fools Dan Caplinger and David Meier giving a 110 rating to sports gambling data provider Sportradar ticker symbol SRAD First well hit the business including factors like industry and competition A ten is invincible a one is hopeless Davids going with an eight Dans going with a seven David I know youre pretty hot on this stock why dont you tell us about the business David Meier Sure Sportradar licenses sports data from leagues and sports literally all around the world What it does is it takes that data and turns it into a variety of different content and betting opportunities that it sells to its customers whether its a Draft Kings on the betting side or a CBS sports on the content side The company has proven itself to be both a smart buyer of the data and a smart seller of its products and for that reason I think its a very good business model Dan Caplinger I gave it a seven I like the business model as well Davids right Theres a whole lot of betting services out there across the world Plenty of competition in that space in a highly competitive market I love to look at the pick and shovel places the underlying businesses that make these industries go These betting sites cant do what they do without the data to back them up Thats what Sportradar is giving them I like it I gave them a seven Anand Chokkavelu Give the apps the data I take that data on the apps I convert it into losses You might want to invest in me laughs Lets go on to management A 10 is Warren Buffett a one is Homer Simpson David gives an eight Dan gives a seven This time well go with Dan Dan Caplinger Ive got a lot of confidence in founder CEO Carsten Koerl We like to see founders who are invested in their businesses Koerl is 23yearveteran in the business and prior to that he worked at an actual betting site and so he understands what his betting site customers need from Sportradar I think that helps to inform his leadership style has done well operationally as well as from a stock performance standpoint David Meier As you said on it I gave it an eight and I completely agree Carsten Koerl has been a great founder CEO Interestingly he reorganized the company in early 2024 in order to simplify the business structure In the process in my opinion he hired a very key new executive whose name is Behshad Behzadi Behshad is now the chief technical officer and chief AI officer Basically what theyre doing is bringing their technology platform and their analytics platform into the modern era Ive been impressed so far and I look forward to seeing what they do with the business going forward Anand Chokkavelu For financials a 10 is a fortress a one is yikes Davids going with an eight Dans a bit lower at a six Start with the bull case here David David Meier laughs It was a little rough actually in 2023 but growth has returned and thats on the back of extending and expanding its deal with the NBA and a number of other sports leagues around the world I expect to see additional scale going forward as this growth persists You got to remember the way this works is they pay money upfront to get the licensing deals and over time they monetize it Thats how we should see the scale from the new deals Anand Chokkavelu I dont think I disagree with anything David said I think I just ding Sportradar a little bit for that rough patch that hes talking about Theyve shown nice revenue growth Theres modest profitability I like the fact that the balance sheets relatively strong minimal debt significant amounts of cash available to inform strategic decisions or reinvestments in the business Its just I like to see more consistent The fact that you go through a rough patch I think is probably the reason why our scores differ on that score Real quick David before we go on evaluation I have a follow up question which is why do the apps need Sportradar as a middle person between the leagues and the apps David Meier Ill use DraftKings as an example again What is DraftKings core competency Its marketing Theyre not in the analytics business in terms of how do I interface with the sporting data Thats what Sportradar is good at and so its better for a company like DraftKings and many others to go to Sportradar to get the betting opportunity and present it to its customers Anand Chokkavelu Beautiful Lets move on to valuation Dan well start with you How well will Sportradar stock do over the next five years How safe is it Ten is a sure thing one is a lottery ticket Dan Caplinger I put five year returns of five to 10 Some might think that thats low Thats actually pretty much middle of the road for me I like the stock is starting to gain some momentum here New legalizations at the state level for online gambling in the US I think is helping the industry overall Questions whether that expansion will continue I give them a safety score of six just because I think theres some question about that future direction and the extent of future growth that we havent already seen priced into the stock David Meier Im agreeing with Dan on the safety score I also gave it a six As you noted earlier I am a bull I think theres 15 plus returns available even after the recent rise in the stock One of the reasons is this is the industry leader and they are a trusted partner Theyve been able to renew their contracts at higher and higher levels for a number of years The paradox here is actually the United States is the emerging market here Dan pointed to legalization within different US states That is absolutely a growth Those are the growth opportunities going forward Theres definitely risk though You can pay too much for the data You could price your bets and your contents poorly I also think theres risk but I think the return potential is very much worth it Anand Chokkavelu Everyones favorite topic Dan is there accompanying Sportradar space you like more It depends how you want to define the space Im not really sure theres any other company that does sports data the way the Sportradar does When you broaden it out to the betting world more broadly Id go with MGM Resorts ticker MGM Its a betting site provider It might be a potential customer Sportradar they also have the Brick and Mortar Casino resorts You have a good loyalty program The loyalty has branched out to talk with other loyalty programs like the Marriott Bonvoy program Its got exposure to the Asian gaming capital of Macau I think its an interesting play right now David Meier The direct competitor is a company called Genius Sports ticker is GENI I agree with Dan you got to broaden out a little bit One company I think thats very interesting is a maker and licenser of digital casino games I learned about this company from our colleague Bill Mann and the company is called Evolution AB Its a little tough to trade on because its on the pink sheets but that is a very interesting company Anand Chokkavelu You like it more than Sportradar David David Meier Yes but its hard to buy Anand Chokkavelu Thats what makes it all so worthwhile right David Meier Yeah Anand Chokkavelu laughs Thank you to David and Dan Theyve given Sportradar pretty good overall score of 71 out of 10 short of that 80 that would force me to own shares Left to his own devices though David would have given it an eight if you average all his scores Its one Ive been meaning to look at actually because David got it on my radar a few months ago

before making a Buy Sell or Hold decision about a stock While media reports about rating changes by these brokeragefirm employed or sellside analysts often affect a stocks price do they really matter Lets take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Amazon AMZN before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage Amazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation ABR of 110 on a scale of 1 to 5 Strong Buy to Strong Sell calculated based on the actual recommendations Buy Hold Sell etc made by 50 brokerage firms An ABR of 110 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy Of the 50 recommendations that derive the current ABR 46 are Strong Buy and three are Buy Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 92 and 6 of all recommendations Check price target stock forecast for Amazon here While the ABR calls for buying Amazon it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential Do you wonder why As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias According to our research brokerage firms assign five Strong Buy recommendations for every Strong Sell recommendation In other words their interests arent always aligned with retail investors rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading Therefore the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stocks price movement Zacks Rank our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record categorizes stocks into five groups ranging from Zacks Rank 1 Strong Buy to Zacks Rank 5 Strong Sell and is an effective indicator of a stocks price performance in the near future Therefore using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5 they are two completely different measures The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals example 128 In contrast the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions It is displayed in whole numbers 1 to 5 It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations Because of their employers vested interests these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support misguiding investors far more often than helping them In contrast the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions And nearterm stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions according to empirical research Furthermore the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year In other words at all times this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness When you look at the ABR it may not be uptodate Nonetheless since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough it is always timely in predicting future stock prices In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Amazon the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 16 over the past month to 528 Analysts growing optimism over the companys earnings prospects as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates has resulted in a Zacks Rank 1 Strong Buy for Amazon You can see the complete list of todays Zacks Rank 1 Strong Buy stocks here Therefore the Buyequivalent ABR for Amazon may serve as a useful guide for investors

performance and what to expect going forward Of course one figure often stands out among the rest earnings The earnings figure itself is key but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as if not more important Therefore investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher The Zacks Earnings ESP or Expected Surprise Prediction aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications Amazon AMZN earns a Zacks Rank 1 27 days from its next quarterly earnings release on February 6 2025 and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at 174 a share By taking the percentage difference between the 174 Most Accurate Estimate and the 153 Zacks Consensus Estimate Amazon has an Earnings ESP of 1345 AMZN is just one of a large group of RetailWholesale stocks with a positive ESP figure Texas Roadhouse TXRH is another qualifying stock you may want to consider Slated to report earnings on February 20 2025 Texas Roadhouse holds a 2 Buy ranking on the Zacks Rank and its Most Accurate Estimate is 167 a share 41 days from its next

name for relevant results Prologis NYSE PLD is not only the largest owner of industrial real estate in the United States but also the largest real estate investment trust or REIT of any kind While the business itself is performing quite well there are some fears regarding the state of industrial real estate as well as the interest rate environment and these have caused the stock to fall by more than 20 from its 52week high Heres a rundown of how Prologis business is doing why the stock is down and why it could be a good idea to take a closer look at this fantastic company right now Prologis is a massive REIT that specializes in logistics properties such as warehouses and distribution centers If youve ever seen one of those massive Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN fulfilment centers thats the type of property Im referring to In fact Amazon is Prologis largest tenant by a wide margin As of the latest quarter Prologis owns more than 12 billion square feet of rentable space located on four continents around the world It leases space to 6700 different customers with top tenants in addition to Amazon including Home Depot NYSE HD FedEx NYSE FDX and UPS NYSE UPS Just to put this scale into perspective 27 trillion worth of goods moves through Prologis properties every year representing nearly 3 of the worlds GDP This is a big real estate business There are a few valid reasons Prologis is down more than most other REITs For one thing there are some concerns that overbuilding during the COVID19 pandemic combined with economic worries will lead to falling occupancy And to be sure Prologis occupancy has fallen from 977 to 959 over the past two years and its retention rate is 70 basis points lower To be sure this feels like more of a normalization after an excellent few years but it is definitely worth watching More importantly the persistent highinterest rate environment has put pressure on commercial real estate values I wont get too deep into the details but capitalization rates cap rates are a solid indicator of property values Lower cap rates mean higher property values relative to rental income In a nutshell think of a cap rate as the propertys net rental income as a percentage of its market value Since 2021 industrial real estate cap rates have increased from 41 to about 54 and the general idea is that this means industrial property values are down by about 25 Despite the legitimate concerns and headwinds there are some good reasons why Prologis could be a great stock to buy right now Just to name a few Ecommerce demand continues to rise Only about 225 of retail sales are ecommerce in Prologis markets This percentage has been steadily growing for the past two decades and is expected to reach nearly 30 by 2028 Ecommerce needs three times as much warehouse space than brickandmortar retail Prologis has been quietly getting into the data center real estate business and is targeting 78 billion in development spending by 2028 This could allow the company to be a big beneficiary of the AI investment boom Prologis has a great track record of creating shareholder value through development estimated at 136 billion so far It sees the potential for over 40 billion in future development which could be a big growth driver going forward While interest rate cuts are likely to be slower than initially expected in 2025 the overwhelming consensus is that the direction of interest rates will be lower for the next several years This not only means lower borrowing costs but should also help lower cap rates and therefore make industrial properties more valuable Prologis has lots of embedded rent growth in its portfolio In simple terms industrial property rent surged during the COVID19 pandemic but many of the companys leases were initiated before it started As the older leases expire well see rental income increase In fact Prologis estimates that market rates are about 35 more than it is currently receiving from its properties on average Finally Prologis trades for a significant discount to its historical pricetoFFO funds from operations valuation While there could certainly be shortterm headwinds in the real estate space Prologis is an extremely solid business and it looks like an excellent time for patient longterm investors to buy Before you buy stock in Prologis consider this The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now and Prologis wasnt one of them The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in

incredible 2579 in 2024 according to data provided by SP Global Market Intelligence The company started the year as an integrated retail electricity and power generation company and it ended the year by becoming one of the years hottest artificial intelligence AI plays on the market The boom in AI applications in 2024 brought with it the concomitant need to invest in data centers to support that growth Ill get to Vistras role in a moment first a few words on how nuclear power became popular in 2024 There is a critical need to secure a longterm reliable power source for data centers and nuclear power is increasingly seen as the answer Nuclear power is seen as a carbonfree way to ensure reliable power and it has become even more popular considering renewable energys difficulties in recent years including surging costs logistics issues and supply chain constraints Indeed its no coincidence that the most significant three cloud service providers signed deals with nuclear power producers in 2024 Microsoft inked a longterm power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy to restart part of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant Alphabets Google signed a deal to buy nuclear energy from small modular reactors SMR developed by Kairos Power Meanwhile Amazons Amazon Web Services paid 650 million to buy a data center campus from Talen Energy and signed a longterm deal to buy power from Talens nearby nuclear plant Amazon also signed deals to support the development of SMRs While the AmazonTalen deal received a blow when the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected a proposal allowing Talen to sell more power to Amazon the IT giant has subsequently reaffirmed its commitment to the original equipment The company started the year with only 2400 megawatts MW of its 36702 MW of generating capacity coming from nuclear but significantly added to that figure with the completion of a deal to acquire Energy Harbor in March adding 4000 MW of nuclear generation capacity Vistra would then acquire the remaining 15 it didnt own in Vistra Vision which held its nuclear assets among others The deal was perfect timing and investors now anticipate that Vistra will also sign

risky endeavor However amid the uncertainty there are standout performers Lets delve into three promising names TechnipFMC plc Coterra Energy and Sunoco LP These companies have demonstrated impressive EPS growth in recent years positioning them as attractive buys at the current levels for investors seeking potential longterm gains in this dynamic industry TechipFMC Amid the challenges posed by volatile energy prices in todays market TechnipFMC has emerged as a standout Headquartered in the UK TechnipFMC was established in January 2017 through the merger of Technip and FMC Technologies The company specializes in manufacturing supplying and delivering fully integrated technology solutions and services tailored to the energy industry Zacks Rank 1 Strong Buy TechnipFMCs stock price has trended higher in the recent past with its valuation also supporting more upside potential Trading close to its 52week high of 3264 a share and with 1590X forward earnings FTI stock remains well below its historical median of 1848X You can see the complete list of todays Zacks 1 Rank Strong Buy stocks here TechnipFMC has dropped 191 in a decade but has climbed 786 over the last 12 months comfortably outperforming the benchmark SP 500 Index FTI earnings are expected to have more than tripled for 2024 and increase another 246 in 2025 to 201 per share As a matter of fact 2025 could witness an attractive 235 increase from the 2019 adjusted EPS of 60 cents a share Coterra Energy Another candidate for attractive EPS growth is Coterra Energy It belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas Exploration Production US industry It is an independent upstream operator primarily engaged in the exploration development and production of natural gas CTRA is currently 1 Ranked Trading at a little over 27 per share and 970X forward earnings CTRA has a Value Score of B The company trades 70 below its fiveyear high of 3275X and is under the median of 988X Coterra Energy has more than doubled over the last five years to beat the SP 500s increase of 101 But the stock has just managed a meager 44 gain over the last six months underperforming the benchmark during the period In other words Coterra Energy shares appear to be oversold at the moment considering its strong fundamentals and valuation CTRA earnings are forecast to rise 801 in 2025 to 290 per share That would be an outstanding 79 increase from the 2019 adjusted EPS of 162 a share Sunoco LP Rounding out the list is Sunoco LP which participates in the transportation and supply phase of the US petroleum market across a number of states It also focuses on motor fuel distribution to convenience stores independent dealers and commercial customers Sunoco also carries a Zacks Rank of 1 with earnings estimates for 2025 moving up 44 over the last 60 days Moreover at 5246 per share and 534X forward earnings SUN trades far more conservatively compared to its 10year high of 3065X and the median of 1152X While Sunoco stock lost 46

likely spent years innovating and evolving That describes Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA well as it originally developed leading central processing unit CPU computer chips used in gaming and eventually cryptocurrency mining applications Now its the leading supplier for artificial intelligence AI applications Nvidia has been all the rage among market watches recently but the company has been around for over 30 years Its been publicly traded since early 1999 CEO Jensen Huang was among the founders who initially aimed to develop graphics chips for personal computers Its CUDA compute unified device architecture software platform was launched almost 20 years ago and it is now an important part of the investment case The focus in its early years was on performance improvements in 3D graphics used in the gaming industry But the stock performance lagged until the early 2020s when revenue began to grow from the Nvidia RTX platform that uses AI to create realistic graphics and visual effects for gaming 3D design and other uses Huangs keynote speech at the recent CES conference was used to introduce the RTX 50series chips that use Nvidias Blackwell graphics processing unit GPU architecture in the companys AI accelerators That circle of innovation is what investors need to keep in mind to see what Nvidia can do in the coming decade And Huang gave everyone a brief introduction to whats coming in that CES keynote address Nvidias recent stock returns have been nothing short of phenomenal As AI drives the need for more computing power quarterly revenue increased by over 1000 since 2020 Much of that came in the last two years as large tech companies spent heavily to build out data centers needed for AI applications Those companies are still investing to boost compute power Microsoft President Brad Smith recently said his company expects to invest 80 billion in its fiscal 2025 for AIenabled data centers used to train models Smith commented None of this progress would be possible without new partnerships founded on largescale infrastructure investments that serve as the essential foundation of AI innovation and use Amazon also recently announced it has plans to spend about 11 billion to expand its presence in Georgia to support Amazon Web Services AWS cloud computing and AI technologies Nvidia is arguably the biggest beneficiary of this spending and investors have poured into the stock driving shares over 2000 higher since 2020 Nvidias data center segment dominated its revenue path recently but gaming revenue is still growing and represented a meaningful 94 of total revenue in the recent quarter Huang sees another avenue for growth coming Nvidias secondfastestgrowing segment in the most recent quarter was automotive and robotics with a 72 yearoveryear revenue increase In his CES conference speech Huang spoke a lot about robots and selfdriving cars two realworld applications made possible by AI Huang sees the robotics era coming soon and grouped both humanoid robots and selfdriving cars in that category He said it could be the largest technology industry the world has ever seen Nvidias robot operating system ROS Isaac utilizes its CUDAaccelerated software packages and AI models to develop advanced AI robotics applications He also announced Nvidias nextgeneration processor for autonomous cars called Thor Thor processes the massive amount of sensor information from cameras radar and lidar light detection and ranging being used on vehicles Using Nvidias latest CPU and GPU advances including Blackwell architecture Huang said Thor has 20 times the processing capability of the previous generation chip which is the standard today The Thor processor is also used for humanoid robots Huang described it as a universal robotics computer One can see how each of Nvidias segments and innovations is interconnected And thats precisely why Nvidia stock could still be the best investment of the next decade Huang said he expects surprisingly rapid breakthroughs in general robotics in the next several years And Nvidia supplies all the enabling technologies As if it needs another growth segment Huang also introduced an AI desktop computer at CES that incorporates Blackwell He said Placing an AI supercomputer on the desks of every data scientist AI researcher and student empowers them to engage and shape the age of AI That desktop supercomputer will be available in May for a price of 3000 Its another example of the companys innovative approach that pushes the boundaries of technology Nvidia has many ongoing projects and somehow seems to connect them all It should be a core holding in any growth stock portfolio for the next decade Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks Then youll want to hear

became the first 1 billion company in 1901 General Motors rode the automotive boom to become the firstever 10 billion company in 1955 General Electric which manufactures refrigerators and airplane engines among many other things became the worlds first 100 billion company in 1995 Apple hit the most significant milestone to date when its valuation crossed 1 trillion for the first time in 2018 thanks to the success of devices like the iPhone Apple is still the worlds largest company with a market capitalization of 37 trillion But since 2018 seven other American technology companies have joined it in the trilliondollar club Microsoft Nvidia Amazon Alphabet Meta Platforms Tesla and Broadcom I think one more company is set to earn its membership in this club within the next four years Some of the biggest artificial intelligence AI developers in the world are lining up to rent Oracles NYSE ORCL industryleading data center infrastructure and this part of its business could grow more than tenfold according to managements guidance Oracles market cap is 463 billion as of this writing so if it does join the 1 trillion club in four years as I predict investors who buy its stock today could earn a very nice return of 116 Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts data center operators like Oracle Microsoft and Amazon will spend 1 trillion over the next four years on upgrading their infrastructure to meet demand from AI developers That involves filling them with thousands of graphics processors GPUs which are specialized chips designed to ingest and process mountains of data for AI workloads Nvidia supplies the most powerful GPUs in the industry And Oracles Cloud Infrastructure OCI supercluster technology enables developers to scale up to 65000 of Nvidias H200 GPUs which is the highest number in the industry To put it simply access to more chips can enable developers to build and deploy larger models which translates into smarter AI software OCIs random direct memory access RDMA technology also allows data to flow from one point to another much faster than traditional Ethernet networks And since most developers rent computing capacity by the minute faster processing can equal major cost savings During its recent fiscal 2025 second quarter ended Oct 31 Oracle said GPU use climbed by 336 compared to the same period in fiscal 2024 which speaks to how quickly demand is ramping up So far OCIs infrastructure has attracted top AI startups like Cohere OpenAI and Elon Musks xAI Oracle currently operates 98 data center regions and plans to grow that footprint by more than tenfold to somewhere between 1000 and 2000 locations over time The companys OCI will soon offer new clusters featuring over 131000 of Nvidias latest Blackwell GPUs which will pave the way for the most advanced AI applications yet and potentially drive a new wave of demand Oracle generated 141 billion in total revenue during the second quarter but the OCI segment was responsible for just 24 billion of that total so it isnt a massive contributor yet Its still smaller than Oracles softwareasaservice SaaS business which generated 35 billion in revenue during the quarter It offers readymade cloud applications to help businesses across dozens of industries manage everything from their inventory to their payroll However OCI is consistently the star performer when it comes to growth While SaaS revenue grew by 10 year over year during the second quarter OCI revenue soared by 52 It was the fastest growth in a year and it marked the second consecutive quarter of acceleration OCI revenue would have grown even faster if Oracle had more data center capacity available but its still struggling to meet demand even though its building infrastructure as quickly as possible That demand can be seen in Oracles remaining performance obligations RPOs which soared by 50 during the second quarter to 97 billion RPOs typically convert into revenue at a future date once the company can deliver the agreedupon services ie OCI revenue could surge once it can bring more data centers on line based on the deals it has already locked in Oracle CEO Safra Catz predicts RPOs will grow even higher from here because of the sheer volume of deals the company is signing including a major one with Meta Platforms recently Meta developed the worlds most popular opensource large language models LLMs called Llama which have been downloaded over 600 million times and the company will shift some of its training workloads over to Oracles infrastructure Oracle stock trades at a pricetoearnings ratio PE of 405 which is a slight premium to the average PE of Microsoft Amazon and Alphabet 367 They are three of the biggest operators of AI data center infrastructure besides Oracle But Oracle stock looks much more attractive when we measure its value based on its potential earnings For example Wall Streets consensus estimate provided by Yahoo suggests the companys earnings per share EPS will grow by 144 to 705 during its fiscal year 2026 which starts in June of this calendar year That places its stock at a forward PE of just 235 Mathematically speaking Oracle stock would have to soar by 723 over the next 18 months just to maintain its current PE of 405 which would value the company at almost 800 billion If it grows its EPS by 144 again in fiscal 2027 and fiscal 2028 while maintaining the same PE it will be a 104 trillion company Even if its PE settles at 367 its valuation would still be around 950 billion But Oracles earnings actually grew by 22 in the first half of fiscal 2025 and I think that pace is likely to persist and maybe even accelerate suggesting Wall Street might be too conservative Remember The company plans to grow its data center footprint more than tenfold And its infrastructure is unique because its fully automated meaning it should become significantly more profitable at scale In fact during the last couple of quarterly conference calls with investors Catz talked about how the gross profit margin of the infrastructure business is climbing as more data centers come on line If Oracle grows its earnings by 22 annually instead of 14 through fiscal 2028 it will be a shooin to join the 1 trillion club even if its PE drops to around 34 Before you buy stock in Oracle consider this The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just

gains or higher since the 1990s There are 11 stock market sectors but only three beat the SP 500 last year communications financials and consumer discretionary Even the technology sector underperformed the SP 500 last year In fact only 148 SP 500 components beat the index last year meaning over 70 of components underperformed the index Heres why these three standout sectors did well last year how they can carry the momentum forward this year and lowcost exchangetraded funds ETFs you can use to invest in each sector Communications was the bestperforming sector last year producing a 348 total return capital gains plus dividends The sector was led by its three highestweighted components Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Meta Platforms NASDAQ META and Netflix NASDAQ NFLX which rose 355 654 and 831 respectively in 2024 Besides social media and streaming companies the sector has traditional media giants like Comcast and Walt Disney telecom companies and more Despite running up in 2023 and 2024 the sector remains a good value going into 2025 Legacy media companies and telecom titans tend to pay dividends and feature inexpensive valuations Even Alphabet and Meta have reasonable valuations because they generate tons of free cash flow and solid earnings growth The sector depends heavily on advertising and consumer spending So a downturn in those categories could result in slowing growth and even a sectorwide selloff But the longterm outlook for the sector is encouraging especially given Metas success with monetizing Instagram and Netflixs expanding margins and pricing power Vanguard offers lowcost sectorbased ETFs with 01 expense ratios The Vanguard Communications ETF NYSEMKT VOX mirrors the sectors performance making it a simple yet effective tool for investing in stocks like Alphabet and Meta The financial sector was a standout winner in 2024 The sector includes Berkshire Hathaway big banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley regional banks payment processors like Visa Mastercard and American Express insurance companies and more The sector has done well amid relatively higher interest rates Banks can see expanded net interest margins during periods of higher rates because the difference between the rates they collect on lending like mortgages and car loans and what they pay on deposits and savings accounts widens But higher interest rates can also slow economic growth Last year stood out because economic growth was solid despite higher rates Integrated banks and investment banks thrived with many of those companies seeing record profits and stock prices Payment processors like Visa had slowing growth but were remarkably resilient thanks to network effects that led to moderate earnings growth despite pressured consumer spending The financials sector has run up a considerable amount so it isnt as compelling a value as it used to be But relative to the SP 500 it is still a decent value The Vanguard Financials ETF NYSEMKT VFH features a 171 pricetoearnings ratio PE and a 16 dividend yield compared to a 271 PE and a 12 yield for the Vanguard SP 500 ETF NYSEMKT VOO Economic slowdowns can affect the sector making it cyclical So investors should be aware of the potential volatility before diving headfirst into the Vanguard Financials ETF The consumer discretionary sector had a slow start to the year but a secondhalf rally by Tesla NASDAQ TSLA and a new record high for Amazon NASDAQ AMZN helped polevault it to a 266 total return in 2024 It contains industries you may have thought were in a different sector For example carmakers like Tesla and legacy automakers fall under the consumer discretionary sector although theres a case to be made that Tesla is more of a technology company and automakers like Ford Motor Company and General Motors are industrial Similarly Amazon and MercadoLibre are techfocused companies in the consumer discretionary sector The sector holds many familiar names like McDonalds Starbucks and Nike Like the other sector ETFs on this list the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF NYSEMKT VCR is fairly topheavy with a combined 457 weighting in Amazon Tesla Home Depot and Lowes Companies Beyond that the fund achieves solid diversification with 298 components It can be highly cyclical Slowdowns in consumer spending can affect home improvement budgets and lead to pullbacks on categories like expensive vacations or dining out Runups in Amazon and Telsa have made the sector more expensive with a PE ratio around the SP 500 average and a yield of just 07 But it can continue producing marketbeating gains if the economy grows reasonably and consumers open up their pocketbooks on discretionary goods and services The communications financials and consumer discretionary sectors include completely different industries But all three sectors can be cyclical and vulnerable to ebbs and flows in the business cycle By knowing the leading components in each sector you can know what to expect from each one based on how different companies perform For example it would be very challenging for the communications sector to beat the SP 500 if there were a major selloff in Alphabet and Meta Similarly Amazon and Tesla could drag down the consumer discretionary sector even if the rest of it does well Its a bad idea to invest in any sector or ETF if youre trying to time the market Betting big on a theme or idea just to make a quick buck is a great way to lose your shirt However if you like a sectors top holdings for their longterm potential buying a lowcost ETF can be a great way to achieve diversification Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks Then youll want to hear this On rare

tech stocks in 2024 with expectations for a second consecutive year of doubledigit gains Lip was against the prevailing sentiment among investors that big tech has peaked and that funds should rotate into smaller stocks or other themes He argued that the recent weakness in the tech sector is largely due to technical rebalancing rather than a fundamental downturn He emphasized that cash is likely to flow back into leading tech stocks as they are projected to deliver the highest earnings growth in 2025 with an anticipated earnings increase of over 20 Discussing high valuations in the tech sector particularly for largecap stocks trading at forward earnings multiples between 32 and 35 times Lip countered that many valuations remain within one standard deviation of their historical norms

Collins hypothesizes that a crisis of \"convenience over conviction\" due to changing public sentiment is driving such changes in the corporate landscape. \"Leaders in these organizations are following where the wind is blowing,\" Collins explains. \"The populace seems to be moving in this direction, and therefore they follow suit.\" Collins also highlights the importance of long-term impact over short-term gains in diversity, equity, and inclusion.

administration released an updated export rule aimed at controlling the flow of artificial intelligence chips to adversaries such as China The White House said the rule would cap the number of AI chips called GPUs graphics processing units that can be ordered by most countries without a special license Smaller orders of 1700 or fewer GPUs would not count toward the export cap Artificial intelligence is quickly becoming central to both security and economic strength the White House said in a statement Monday The United States must act decisively to lead this transition by ensuring that US technology undergirds global AI use and that adversaries cannot easily abuse advanced AI Some 18 key US allies including the UK Netherlands and Taiwan will face no restrictions on shipments of AI chips and 24 countries that are subject to arms controls such as China North Korea and Russia still face an outright ban on receiving exports of the latest AI chips The primary significance of the updated restrictions is in their cap on the amount of compute capacity in a given group of AI chips that can be shipped to the remaining countries in the world Under the rule US companies could ship AI chips with a total processing power equal to roughly 50000 Nvidia Hopper chips or 20000 of its latest Blackwell chips Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said The countries subject to this cap include US allies like Switzerland and Israel For reference Microsoft MSFT alone reportedly purchased 485000 of Nvidias Hopper GPUs in 2024 while Meta META purchased 224000 of the AI chips according to the Financial Times The rule aims to close loopholes in prior export restrictions on AI chips in 2022 and 2023 by thwarting smuggling and raising AI security standards the White House said These restrictions will make it even more difficult for Chinese entities to purchase the most advanced NVIDIA chips DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance in an email Monday While there have been some restrictions on chip sales already there have been reports of advanced NVIDIA chips making it to China likely due to the fact that NVIDIA has limited control over its resellers Luria explained in an earlier email last week In addition to Nvidias advanced chips sold through resellers Nvidia makes specific versions of chips that comply with current US trade restrictions on China Sales of Nvidias H20 chips its Hopper chips for China should be unaffected by the controls Rasgon wrote in the note Nvidia vice president of government affairs Ned Finkle said in a statement Monday that the rule was drafted in secret and without proper legislative review And by attempting to rig market outcomes and stifle competition the lifeblood of innovation the Biden administrations new rule threatens to squander Americas hardwon technological advantage he said Companies have a longerthantypical 120day period to provide commentary on the restrictions Bloomberg reported giving the Trump administration time to make changes to the rule which is set to go into effect in one year Nvidias statement included a seeming appeal to the incoming administration As the first Trump Administration demonstrated America wins through innovation competition and by sharing our technologies with the world not by retreating behind a wall of government overreach Finkle said We look forward to a return to policies that strengthen American leadership bolster our economy and preserve our competitive edge in AI and beyond In a note to investors early Monday Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya reiterated his Buy rating on Nvidia stock but noted that the tougher export rule muddies the waters for the AI chipmaker Citi analyst Atif Malik said that while the news was not too surprising the new 50000 GPU export cap on 120 countries presents risks to Nvidias sales of GPUs for data centers which make up the vast majority of Nvidia revenue Nvidia stocks drop Monday extends its decline from Friday when shares dropped 3 in anticipation of the updated export controls It is now down around 9 over the last five sessions The stock was also under pressure after HSBC lowered its price target on Nvidia shares to

incorporation of AI and its positioning within the metaverse its important not to overlook the companys foundational social media operations that generate the lions share of its revenue and cash flow During the Septemberended quarter the companys family of apps which includes Facebook Instagram WhatsApp Facebook Messenger and Threads attracted 329 billion daily active users There isnt a social media company that comes particularly close to luring as many users as Meta which is an important distinction that affords it exceptional pricing power when dealing with advertisers Something else to keep in mind is that addriven businesses like Meta are ideally positioned to take advantage of longwinded periods of economic growth Even though recessions are normal and inevitable aspects of the economic cycle theyre historically shortlived A simple buyandhold approach for a leading advertiser like Meta has worked wonders for investors Being an absolute cash cow is another reason investors can trust Meta in the new year The company closed out the third quarter with 709 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and its generating an average of more than 21 billion in net

well as reducing the addressable advertising market for legacy media networks But while the ride has been undeniably bumpy for Warner Bros Discovery there is light at the end of the proverbial tunnel Arguably the most exciting catalyst is the companys Decemberannounced reorganization into two separate business units streaming and studios and global linear networks Whereas the latter has been

2025 MicroStrategy held 447470 Bitcoins which equates to 213 of all Bitcoin that will ever be mined Unfortunately Saylors plan to hoard Bitcoin has a number of blatant red flags To begin with Saylor has been funding MicroStrategys Bitcoin purchases through a combination of convertibledebt offerings and ongoing share issuances In late December a filing from the company noted its intention to seek an increase to its outstanding share count from 330 million to 1033 billion Such rampant and reckless dilution could easily come back to haunt the company and its shareholders To build on this point even though MicroStrategys annual debtservicing costs amount to a little more than 35 million the companys enterprise analytics software segment isnt generating enough net cash from operations to cover these interest expenses To make matters worse MicroStrategys Bitcoin portfolio is being valued at an unexplained premium With Bitcoin valued at 94812 per token as of this writing on Jan 12 the companys 447470 Bitcoins are worth about 424 billion However MicroStrategy closed out the previous week with a market cap of 806 billion Generously placing a 1 billion valuation on its struggling software segment investors are pricing MicroStrategys Bitcoin at an 88 premium to its net asset value In other words investors are paying 178000 for MicroStrategys Bitcoins when they could just

banned its WhatsApp messaging service from sharing user data with Meta for advertising purposes according to a court filing by the US company seen by Reuters Meta is seeking to quash the Competition Commission of Indias CCI November directive which found the company abused its dominance and coerced WhatsApp users into accepting a 2021 privacy policy which allegedly expanded user data collection and sharing giving it an unfair advantage over rivals The CCI has imposed a fine of 245 million and a fiveyear ban on the data sharing practice in India the biggest market for Meta where it has more than 350 million Facebook users and over 500 million people using WhatsApp Publicly Meta has defended its policy change and said it disagrees with the CCI order but its appeal filing has taken a critical position on the watchdogs functioning and details how unnerved the US firm is about the CCIs decision The company is concerned that the WhatsApptoMeta user data sharing ban on WhatsApp will curb its ability to offer users personalized ads on Facebook and Instagram according to a Reuters review of its nearly 2000 page filing with the Indian appeals tribunal dated Jan 3 which is not public WhatsApp publicly says it shares with Meta a users phone number transaction data how they interact with businesses and mobile device information Detailing the rulings impact for the first time Meta said in its filing the data sharing ban could mean that an Indian fashion business wont be able to personalize ads on Facebook or Instagram based on their interaction with a WhatsApp user regarding a

woes In 2021 WhatsApp was accused to have violated the EU blocs law by failing to clarify changes to its policy in plain and intelligible language It later agreed to explain the changes to EU users The Indian case started in 2021 amid criticism of WhatsApps privacy policy changes Meta told the CCI the changes were only to provide information about how optional business messaging features work and did not expand its data collection and sharing ability But the CCI disagreed Its ruling in November said WhatsApps policy pushed users to accept or risk losing access to the service and had no optout feature The watchdog has ordered WhatsApp to now allow users to decide whether they want WhatsApp to share data with Meta or not Meta in its Indian tribunal challenge also took a critical

for relevant results We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discussed These 21 Stocks As Bond Yields Soared In this article we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc NASDAQMETA stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed In a recent episode of CNBCs Squawk On The Street Jim Cramer started out by commenting on quantum computing stocks These stocks rose to new highs after the announcement of the Willow quantum computing chip by one of the biggest technology companies in the world He mentioned a quote by AI CEO Jensen Huang about quantum computing According to Cramer The quote previous to that was really enlightening too I mean just as this And this quantum computing only works for small form factor And its used microwave The large form factor which by the way is automatic driving and robots it doesnt work So not only is it later but its not useful And he also said that we work with a CPU not GPU That would be like that Intel engine and its much too slow Cramer continued to blast quantum computing stocks According to him the QTUM ETF that has almost no quantum computing its been bid up I mean they really are David I mean Im not saying they are necessarily fraudulent Because Willow which is a project of Google is pretty good And Amazon was working on a program to help quantum developers Likening the quantum computing stocks to an illusory phenomenon he commented But frankly Im going to use the word chimerical in the sense that these companies none of these companies have much in terms of revenue But theyre all losing a lot of money and it was the type of thing you see at the beginning of the year were also seeing it in nuclear another area thats chimerical And I think that it has to be watched out before we can go higher As a result Cramer shared I think that people should sell those stocks and lock in their gains Quantum computing isnt the only sector on his radar though Another sector in Cramers crosshairs was nuclear power He believes that firms cant build nuclear power plants fast enough and theyre very expensive and the overruns are ridiculous So we have to clear out the nuke and we have to clear out this ridiculous stuff when it comes to quantum Since treasury yields were rising during the start of the day they didnt miss Cramers attention either He shared the trend of the rising yields and started with the futures The futures were up during Frank Hollands show Which is the five oclock show he stated Cramer added Okay so then we had the rates right where they are And then somehow between four thirty and six the rates skyrocketed And then after the ADP they went lower He believes that excessive attention on the yields is equivalent to being worse than the analysts that are telling you to sell the worlds leading GPU designer Another player that has shaped the market for two years now is the Federal Reserve The Fed caused quite a bit of turmoil in midDecember after its paring back of expected 2025 interest rate cuts to two from four hit stocks hard Now with the labor market being as strong as ever investors are wary of getting even one rate cut in the first half of 2025 Cramer commented on the Feds Christopher Waller and shared that He ought to take a vacation Why do these guys have to talk every minute I mean what good are they doing to the chairman The chairman ought to say hey guys go speak at the Rotary Club and address what I think is the biggest problem of youth The CNBC host also mentioned the ongoing and devastating wildfires in California Cramer stressed that these are not ordinary wildfires Recalling his days as a news reporter he shared When I covered homicides and fires when I was a reporter in LA I was living in my car so I was

important AI news and ratings on investors radar On Monday the US government revealed that it would further restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports As reported by Reuters the goal behind these restrictions is to help the US advance its computing power and AI technology while finding more ways to block Chinas access Under the new regulations the number of AI chips exported to most countries will be capped allowing unlimited access to US AI technology for Americas closest allies Meanwhile a block shall be maintained on exports to China Russia Iran and North Korea The US leads AI now both AI development and AI chip design and its critical that we keep it that way READ NOW Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Streets Radar and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings These regulations are seemingly the last efforts by the Biden administration to maintain US leadership in AI and close any loopholes in controlling the flow of AI chips The new administration set to take office on January 20 shares similar views on the competitive threat from China However Presidentelect Donald Trump is expected to make significant changes to the Biden administrations stance on artificial intelligence We will repeal Joe Bidens dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI innovation and imposes radical leftwing ideas on the development of this technology In its place Republicans support AI development rooted in free speech and human flourishing With only a few days left until Trump takes office the recently revealed restrictions on AI chips have been imposed on advanced graphics processing units GPUs which are used to power data centers needed to train AI models Moreover under the new rules cloud providers will be able to build data centers by applying for global approval Once approved they wont need export licenses for AI chips which will allow them to build data centers in countries that cannot import enough chips because of the USimposed quotas However these authorized companies must abide by stringent conditions and restrictions such as security requirements reporting demands and a plan or track record of respecting human rights Currently the recent regulation divides the world into three tiers 18 countries including Japan Britain South Korea and the Netherlands will essentially be exempt from the rules Moreover 120 other countries including Singapore Israel Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will face country caps whereas armsembargoed countries like Russia China and Iran will not be allowed to receive the technology

With a possible TikTok ban just days away many US users are looking for alternative social media platforms to help them keep up with pop culture or provide the type of entertaining videos that popularized the shortform video app TikTok which has been a cultural phenomenon could be banned on Jan 19 under a law that forces the platform to cut ties with its Chinabased parent company ByteDance or shut down its US operation The fate of social media platform will be decided by the Supreme Court which last week heard oral arguments in a legal challenge to the statute and seemed likely to uphold the law The court could rule on the case as soon as this week Meanwhile Presidentelect Donald Trump has asked the justices to put the law on hold so he can negotiate a political resolution to the issue after he takes office TikTok has more than 170 million users in the US and if it does get banned its not clear which competitors will benefit the most Some experts think established social media platforms such as Instagram and YouTube could see the biggest influx of users But some users are looking for something different and could turn to other apps Here are the different alternatives and what to know about them Xiaohongshu or RedNote Recently some US TikTok users have flocked to the Chinese social media app Xiaohongshu in protest of the looming ban Like TikTok Xiaohongshu which in English means Little Red Book combines ecommerce and shortform videos The app has gained traction in China and other regions with a Chinese diaspora such as Malaysia and Taiwan racking up 300 million monthly active users a majority of whom are young women who use it as a defacto search engine for product travel and restaurant recommendations as well as makeup and skincare tutorials On Tuesday the Xiaohongshu called RedNote by American users and on some app stores was the top downloaded free app in Apples US app store Lemon8 Lemon8 also owned by TikToks parent company ByteDance is a lesserknown lifestyle app that allows users to post pictures and shortform videos Though the platform lets users post TikToklike videos it leans more into pictures and has been described as a mixture of Instagram and Pinterest In the past few weeks many creators have hailed Lemon8 as the place to go if TikTok is banned under federal law Some have also recommended it through paid sponsored posts tagged lemon8partner indicating a recent corporate push to generate more users But the law that targets TikTok also states the divestorban requirement for ByteDance applies generally to apps that are owned or operated by the two companies or any of their subsidiaries That means even though Lemon8 is not explicitly named in the statute its future in the US is also in jeopardy Metas Instagram Instagram launched Reels in 2020 a TikToklike feed of short videos users can create or scroll through The feature has proven to be massively popular and some experts say creators are likely to set up shop there if a TikTok ban does happen As of 2022 Instagram had 2 billion active monthly users Meta no longer discloses user numbers for its individual platforms But could it replace TikTok That depends While many creators currently post on both platforms some experts say the youngest users are unlikely to migrate to a service made popular by their millennial parents And while Metas algorithm is addictive its still not TikTok In the past some TikTok users have also blamed the surge of scrutiny on the platform on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg pointing to a Washington Post report from 2022 that said the tech behemoth paid a Republican consulting firm to undermine TikTok through a nationwide media and lobbying campaign YouTube Though TikTok dominates headlines as a driver of internet trends Pew Research Center says YouTube is actually the most widelyused platform among teens and adults YouTube users can scroll through Shorts just as they can on TikTok or Reels on Instagram and Facebook allowing them to watch hours of bitesized videos Many of the videos featured on YouTube are from TikTok or creators who post to several platforms That said YouTube is still known for its longerformat videos so it may not have the variety of content that TikTok users are looking for at least not yet Snapchat Snapchat launched in 2011 with its infamous disappearing videos remains popular among teens and younger adults The platform gained so much traction that Meta designed a similar feature in Facebook and Instagram called Stories that lets users post photos or videos that disappear within 24 hours In 2020 Snapchat launched another feature that lets users shine a light on the most entertaining Snaps no matter who created them The platform is estimated to have roughly 692 million global monthly active users last year according to eMarketer Twitch For TikTok users who enjoy the TikTok Live feed that features livestreamed videos Twitch could be a good alternative The Amazonowned platform is a leader in the streaming industry and allows users on the platform to watch some of the internets most popular streamers such as Kai Cenat Twitch says it has 105 million monthly visitors Clapper Clapper a TikTok clone has also been gaining some traction amid the looming ban The app was launched in 2020 by Dallasbased entrepreneur Edison Chen and focuses on Gen X and millennial users In September of that year the company described itself in a Facebook post as a free speech platform that did not censor posts and comments But in blog post on its website from 2021 the company wrote it stopped being a Free Speech platform in September 2020 and changed its mission and goals to focus on community Other littleknown apps For TikTok users who want to get away from the overcrowded spots there are lesserknown apps like Triller which is popular for music videos and Zigazoo which was designed with kids in mind If none of these apps tickle your fancy its also possible that other platforms could

lifetime surrounded by womenhis three sisters and three daughtersgetting into martial arts turned on a part of his brain that had been missing He said Its one thing to say we want to be welcoming and make a good environment for everyone and its another to basically say masculinity is bad We swung culturally to that part of the spectrummasculinity is toxic we have to get rid of it He considered the female perspective before shifting back into corporate mode for a moment If youre a woman going into a company it probably feels like its too masculineIt probably feels like there are all these things that are set up that are biased against you You want women to be able to succeed and have companies that can unlock all the value from having great people no matter what their background or gender Lets consider Zuckerbergs definition of masculine energy It seems to be wrapped up in the idea of aggressionwhich is a limited view of masculinity If you look around corporate America masculine energy is distinctly not lackingits at the top of 89 of Fortune 500 companies today It dominated the business world for centuries before the decade or two in which womens leadership has influenced how businesses operate at scale If anything this entire exchange is a sign of just how far the culture has shifted Zuckerberg felt comfortable as a Fortune 500 CEO having this conversation in public Its certainly far from the days when the best known export of Facebooks corporate culture was Sheryl Sandbergs Lean In Emma Hinchliffeemmahinchliffefortunecom The Most Powerful Women Daily newsletter is

stocks without any revenue let alone profit Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals A lossmaking company is yet to prove itself with profit and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up Despite being in the age of techstock bluesky investing many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy buying shares in profitable companies like Meta Platforms NASDAQMETA While this doesnt necessarily speak to whether its undervalued the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation especially if its growing View our latest analysis for Meta Platforms If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient then over the long term youd expect a companys share price to follow its earnings per share EPS outcomes So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research Over the last three years Meta Platforms has grown EPS by 16 per year Thats a pretty good rate if the company can sustain it Topline growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation EBIT margin its a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market The music to the ears of Meta Platforms shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 33 to 42 in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well Thats great to see on both counts You can take a look at the companys revenue and earnings growth trend in the chart below To see the actual numbers click on the chart Of course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future not in the past You could base your opinion on past performance of course but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Meta Platforms Owing to the size of Meta Platforms we wouldnt expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US213b Coming in at 14 of the business that holding gives insiders a lot of influence and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders Looking very optimistic for investors One important encouraging feature of Meta Platforms is that it is growing profits To add an extra spark to the fire significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight That combination is very appealing So yes we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on We dont want to rain on the parade too much but we did also find 1 warning sign for Meta Platforms that you need to be mindful of Theres always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares But for those who consider these important metrics we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by significant insider holdings Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to

intelligence AI has been the top trending sector over the past couple of years However finding pureplay AI stocks that are worth buying has been tougher because doing AI well involves significant financial resources More often the top AI investments have been tech companies with AI segments that are just a part of a broader business One of these AIadjacent companies that appears unstoppable is Meta Platforms NASDAQ META the parent company of Facebook Meta is taking a unique approach to the generative AI arms race its making its model free to use and build on This is a stark difference from many of its competitors but it could be a bet that pays off massively over the long run I think this bodes well for Meta and could be a catalyst for the stock to soar Even though Meta has significant investments in AI augmented reality AR and virtual reality VR its predominantly a digital advertising company In the third quarter Meta generated 406 billion in revenue 399 billion came from advertising that appears on its various social media properties While Meta hopes to diversify its revenue streams by being the AR and VR space leader other investments like AI are being made to help maximize its ad profitability This is why Meta chose to make its generative AI platform free By making it free to use Metas AI is more attractive to users than models that you have to pay for By interacting with and using Metas AI youre providing training and data points for the model so it can better understand you With that information Meta can create ads targeted specifically for you Meta is also training its AI for use in its Orion AR glasses which could be the first useful smart glasses to hit the market Although these are too expensive for the average consumer Meta wants to get the price point down to the cost of a smartphone these could provide contextualized AI assistants that see what we see which unlocks a whole new level of AI integration into society Metas AI investments may not directly affect its revenue statements but the research it is conducting is important in ensuring its other products are topoftheline and incorporate the latest technology Still even with AI not being a huge factor in Metas revenue the stock looks poised to go higher based on its current financial picture Meta had a tremendous 2024 with strong revenue and earningspershare EPS growth in multiple quarters In Q3 its revenue was up 19 year over year and its EPS was up 37 The doubledigitpercentage growth is expected to continue in 2025 with Wall Street analysts projecting 15 revenue growth and 12 EPS growth Analysts forecast that Meta will ramp up its AI spending in 2025 which is why its EPS growth is lower than revenue growth Despite the strong 2024 Meta stock still trades at a fairly attractive price point Trading at 24 times forward earnings Meta is cheaper than many of its big tech counterparts despite growing at a faster pace Stocks in the Nasdaq100 average a forward PE of 264 Given its reasonable valuation and its potential for aboveaverage growth I wouldnt be surprised if Meta has another strong year in 2025 Meta is a company that has a history of producing

Brando in The Godfather That was the fairly straightforward question my husband typed into Google while the movie played in the background over our Thanksgiving break The answer from Googles AI overview Marlon Brando was not yet old enough to act in The Godfather when he died in 2004 at the age of 80 It was one of the funnier somewhat surprising screwups wed seen from Gemini which like all publicly available artificial intelligence tools is prone to what the tech industry calls hallucinations He screenshot the answer so that we could have a laugh about it and then scrolled down to find the first nonsponsored nonAI search result an entry from one of the most reliable places on the internet Wikipedia If Id written that last sentence at the start of my career no editor would have allowed it into print You cant trust something that anyone can edit the thinking went and so it became a bad word in journalism and academia Dont cite it dont even look at it Or if you do for Gods sake dont let anyone see you But over the past two decades the freetouse online encyclopedia has carried on with its mission expanding its global community of volunteer editors known as Wikipedians and ultimately resisting the kinds of platform decay that have claimed other 2000sera internet phenoms like Facebook Twitter and to some extent Google In a statement to Nightcap Google said it maintains a high quality bar with all Search features and that its extensive testing found people find their results more helpful with AI Overviews Meta and X didnt immediately respond to a request for comment Whats emerged is a port in a storm of misinformation and a potential roadmap for startups as Big Tech continues to abdicate any responsibility for the garbage littering its platforms in the form of AIgenerated slop and humangenerated propaganda By the way Brando was 47 at the time he filmed The Godfather and turned 48 shortly after its release in 1972 according to Wikipedia and multiple obituaries Wikipedia is the seventh most popular website on the planet according to analytics firm Similarweb after Google YouTube Facebook Instagram X and WhatsApp It is the only one on that list not owned by Alphabet Meta or Elon Musk who has recently taken aim at what he called Wokepedia for what he and the MAGA right views as liberal bias The nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation hosts Wikipedia generating the bulk of its financing through small donations and grants Thats part of the secret to its success according to Molly White a researcher and prolific Wikipedia editor With Wikipedia there isnt some huge corporation enriching themselves off the backs of the free editing White told me Whereas over on Twitter your free labor is going toward a corporation that is directly enriching Elon Musk Musk promptly fired Twitters trust and safety team when he bought Twitter now called X in 2022 The site now relies on users to factcheck one another through a community notes system that has done little to counter false information according to the Center for Countering Digital Hate X users whove stepped up to try to debunk lies and flag propaganda recently told the Washington Post that their efforts often feel like a game of whackamole Thats the same system that Mark Zuckerberg revealed last week for Meta which is preparing to fire its thirdparty professional factcheckers who are already straining against a flood of conspiracy theories By Zuckerbergs own admission that move is a tradeoff that will mean allowing more bad stuff on the platforms Wikipedias crowdsourcing model isnt perfect the site has an entry on its own reliability in which it acknowledges instances of vandalism and it keeps a list of hoaxes that have taken off there Still as a general rule youre not going to find Marlon Brandos Wikipedia entry not suggest that he wasnt in The Godfather When someone tries to insert bad intel into a Wikipedia page that edit gets flagged to hundreds or thousands of Wikipedians around the world who keep tabs on various pages More than 280000 editors contribute to Wikimedia projects every month according to the organization I asked White why the community notes model which on paper seems in line with the Wikipedia ethos doesnt seem to be working so well on X I think that people who are writing community notes are very much in a reactive frame of mind where its not about providing highquality information its about preventing some of the most egregious misinformation from proliferating With Wikipedia she added theres a baseline level of behavior that the community of editors reinforces People who are trolling or expressing their own political beliefs are not tolerated on the site No wonder Musk dislikes it Bottom line The internets most popular sites are in a state of transition X and Meta are doing away with guardrails Google is forcing unreliable AI to the top of its search results Meanwhile TikTok is facing a ban in the US and lawmakers are forcing Pornhub to block its content in roughly a third of US states Wikipedias stodgy nonprofit model suddenly looks a lot more appealing Its communityfocused approach to moderation is also taking off with platforms like Bluesky which has reportedly surged past 21 million users amid an exodus from X This idea of a social network with the benevolent dictator isnt a particularly sustainable thing White said It works until that benevolent dictator either sells the platform or has a political 180 of his own For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNNcom Google is

banned on Jan 19 under a law that forces the platform to cut ties with its Chinabased parent company ByteDance or shut down its US operation The fate of social media platform will be decided by the

move SIGN UP for TheStreets FREE Daily newsletter Facebook has recently faced criticism for ending factchecking on the platform and replacing it with a system similar to Xs Community Notes However while Zuckerberg discussed the state of social media and what he sees as necessary for the industry he didnt focus too much on that instead he took the opportunity to issue some blunt words for one of his rivals Zuckerberg has a long history of criticizing this company In 2020 he accused them of blocking innovation and competition attempting to frame their actions as harmful to customers Now he seems intent on taking these attacks even further During his appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience Zuckerberg identified some of his problems with one of his Magnificent 7 rivals The Meta CEO has criticized other companies in the space before but in this case he didnt hold back and issued some blunt words for Apple AAPL As noted this is by no means the first time that Zuckerberg has taken shots at Apple In 2020 he accused the tech leader of having a stranglehold over the apps that iPhone users can download alleging that the company can charge monopoly rents as a result Related AI startup smashes funding round signals big changes for healthcare This time however he seems to have new issues with Apple Throughout the hourlong podcast Zuckerberg stated that as he sees it Apple hasnt invented anything important since former CEO Steve Jobs first introduced the iPhone He went on to lay out what he sees as a blatant lack of progress from Apple on both the innovation and business fronts stating I think year over year Im not even sure theyre selling more iPhones at this point I think like the sales might actually be declining Part of it is that each generation doesnt actually get that much better So people are just taking longer to upgrade than they would before Zuckerberg added that he thinks Apples iPhone sales have generally been flat to declining though he did not provide any evidence to support this claim He also questioned how Apple has continued to make money despite its issues accusing the company of squeezing people and having this 30 percent tax on developers While Zuckerberg did quickly praise the Apple AirPods he followed it by arguing that Apple has hindered the ability of other companies to build devices that can easily connect to the iPhone

that he is highly optimistic that a competitor will beat the tech leader reasonably soon as it has been off its game in terms of not releasing innovative things That said Zuckerberg also seems concerned that Apple may overtake his company in the smart glasses market Related Metas new vision might transform AI and social media His company has recently been in focus for its Meta RayBan smart

same integration technology that allows AirPods to connect to an iPhone seamlessly could give them an advantage if they bring a pair of smart glasses to market Apple hasnt provided any updates on its plans for smart glasses recently but Zuckerbergs statements suggest that he is concerned despite alleging a lack of innovation from Metas rival If the company is making progress on a device that can challenge the Meta RayBan smart glasses though it could be precisely what the company needs to pull it out of the current innovation loop Related Veteran fund manager issues dire SP 500 warning for

land Monday and investors reacted accordingly They traded the bellwether social media stock down by more than 1 after digesting the legal headlines on a day when the SP 500 index closed in positive territory with a 02 bump higher The news came from no less an entity than the US Supreme Court which declined Metas request to essentially duck a large class action lawsuit by the companys advertisers The social media giant had appealed a lower courts decision to allow those disgruntled parties to sue for damages as a group In making that ruling last March the 9th US circuit court of appeals in San Francisco said that since the company stood accused of similar alleged misrepresentation of the reach of its ads those advertisers could band together in a class action suit The advertisers are seeking damages that could top 7 billion They accuse Meta which operates the massuser entities Facebook and Instagram of citing the number of accounts rather than that of actual people using such sites The lawsuit could end up being quite sizable According to a Reuters report the class could end up including millions of advertisers comprising both individuals and businesses While Meta is a behemoth one of its Achilles heels is that it is heavily dependent on advertising for its success And while it has the resources to fight this legal battle and pay damages or a settlement having an

entrepreneurs and advocates has launched a campaign to protect social media from the control and influence of billionaires The initiative Free Our Feeds aims to protect Blueskys underlying technology the AT Protocol and leverage it to create an open social media ecosystem that cant be controlled by a single person or company including Bluesky itself The goal of the initiative is to establish a publicinterest foundation that would fund the creation of new interoperable social networks that can run on the AT Protocol and build independent infrastructure to support these new platforms even if Bluesky were to end up in the hands of billionaires The campaign comes a week after Meta announced that it was dropping factchecking and loosening its content moderation rules Meta which owns Facebook and Instagram is publicly traded but Mark Zuckerberg essentially controls the company through his ownership of supervoting shares which make it hard for activist shareholders to oust him or push for changes It also comes as Bluesky saw a recent surge in users who migrated over from X formerly Twitter after owner Elon Musk used the platform to promote the presidential campaign of Donald Trump and other political causes including the rightwing AfD party in Germany Free Our Feeds launched with the support of several notable names including actor Mark Ruffalo director Alex Winter writer Cory Doctorow Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales Mozilla Foundation president Mark Surman and more Robin Berjon an independent technologist and one of the projects nine custodians told TechCrunch that Free Our Feeds was the result of conversations that he and other founding members were having around exploring ways to push for change in the way social media and digital infrastructure works If you think of our road network if all the roads were owned by one or two billionaires and they could tax anything decide whos allowed to go where etc then we would be in trouble Berjon said And digital infrastructure is not as you know obviously big and in your face as a road maybe but it works in exactly the same way It has the exact same dynamic the exact same concentration of power And so essentially what were doing is making sure that this digital infrastructure which is by its nature a public good is governed in the public interest Although the team acknowledges that it shares the same values as Bluesky they believe that the company is susceptible to venture capital pressure and that if it were to end up under a billionaires control users deserve alternative options backed by independent infrastructure The team has been in contact with Bluesky noting that the decentralized network is supportive of their mission to make the AT Protocol billionaireproof Free Our Feeds wants to raise 30 million over three years and has an immediate goal of 4 million to hire a small team and build independent infrastructure The goal of operating infrastructure is to make sure that the AT Protocol that underlies Bluesky can remain open Berjon said Theyve open sourced it people can use it But because theres only one big entity thats Bluesky theres no countervailing power theres no one else to make sure it stays open We intend to operate independent infrastructure from Bluesky thats compatible with them that supports the entire network so that its not only them having a major place there The idea really is to continue raising money to become a credible actor in that space and to use that money to essentially fund other applications Berjon says the AT Protocol is currently mostly being used to build BlueSky but it could also be used to build other types of social apps Using the same infrastructure you could build an Instagram analog a Facebook analog a TikTok analog or you know things that havent been invented yet he said And thats actually the goal Its not just to copy things And in inventing these new things you dont need to reinvent user accounts or storage systems etc People can just use their existing accounts with your new thing because its interoperable with the AT Protocol And so we really want to help people build these new applications Free Our Feeds intends to have the independent foundation established and running by the end of the year Berjon says that if the nonprofit doesnt raise enough funds it will return the money This article originally

about Wall Streets favorite AI GPU stock by opening our full list Cramer emphasized that there is a clear division in the stock market He pointed out Well again I think that theres two markets Theres the healthcare market the materials market uh the food and beverage market David that area is just wasteland He shared that safety isnt on investors minds when understanding the current stock market I learned from my friend Michael Haley who is a demolition man that safety never takes a vacation Cramer shared and added He was not speaking about snacks Because safetys last The CNBC host also commented on a recent report which shared that consumers might be able to save money by using GLP1 weight loss drugs According to him If you want to save some money well look its four hundred dollars That theyre saving And by the way you know the average person in this country four hundred dollars nice saving Another segment thats caught his attention recently is the alcoholic beverages market The Surgeon Generals recent opinion of placing a cancer warning on these beverage bottles hasnt escaped Cramers attention However he doesnt think a warning label will deter consumers Cramer commented that in the aftermath of the Surgeon Generals remarks liquors just being crushed He recalled the Prohibition and shared All I can tell you is that we did this thing in prohibition we had this thing called prohibition it didnt work That was a real way to wipe it out Yet even though the stocks are down they might not have seen different performance had the warning not been issued According to Cramer People dont wanna own these stocks anyways because of interest rates Its just a double whammy Following a comprehensive press conference by Presidentelect Trump bond yields soared as investors fretted about political stability Cramer believes technology stocks are more resilient to rising bond yields but other sectors like healthcare suffer Yet according to him If you were in healthcare right now

company The case is about hurting small businesses believes Cramer However he believes that it should have been about inflation instead Never did she Khan ever say that it was about keeping prices down for the consumer But inflation is the single biggest problem that we have in this country economically And so she completely missed that boat And then she injected Reagan into that he opined
